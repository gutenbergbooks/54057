    <div>AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED</div>
    <div>TO HIS COMRADE IN ARMS,</div>
    <div>THE FRENCH POILU</div>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Good luck, my soldier! You Americans are
an extraordinary people. You are complex.
We have thought we understood you—but, we
do not. We never know what you will do
next.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I asked my French landlady, who thus responded
to the news that I had joined the Foreign
Legion, for an explanation. She said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the early days of the war, when the Germans
advanced upon Paris at the rate of thirty
kilometers a day, driving our French people
before them, pillaging the country, dealing
death and destruction, when our hearts were
torn with grief, Americans who were in Paris
ran about like chickens with their heads cut off.
They could not get their checks cashed; they
had lost their trunks; they thought only of their
own temporary discomfort, and had no sympathy
for our misfortunes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” she continued, “the same ship that
took these people away brought us other Americans.
Strong and vigorous, they did not remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in Paris. Directly to the training camps
they went: and, today, they are lying in mud, in
the trenches with our poilus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, we should like to know, if you please,
which are the real Americans—those who ran
away, and left us when in trouble, or those who
came to help us in time of need. Are you goers
or comers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Self-proclaimed “good Americans,” who
pray that when they die they may go to Paris,
are no more the real Americans than is their
cafed, boulevarded, liqueured-up artificial, gay
night-life Paris—the only Paris they know
(specially arranged and operated, by other foreigners,
for their particular delectation and
benefit!)—the real Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such Americans, whose self-centered world
stands still when their checks are but unhonored
scraps of paper, the light of whose eyes
fades if their personal baggage is gone, with
just one idea of “service”—that fussy, obsequious
attendance, which they buy, are they
whose screaming Eagles spread their powerful
wings on silver and gold coin only. Their “U.
S.” forms the dollar-sign. They are the globe-trotting,
superficial, frivolous “goers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Boys in brown and blue, girls in merciful angels’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>white, men and women of scant impedimenta,
are the “comers,” to whom—and to
whose distant home-fire tenders—“U. S.”
means neither Cash nor Country alone, but a
suffering humanity’s urgent—US. Bonds of
liberty mean, to them, LIBERTY BONDS.
Yes “La Fayette, we are here!” Real Americans
think, shoot and shout, Pershing for the
perishing, “the Yanks are coming over till it’s
over, over there!”</p>

comfort of happy American
homes, when their country

to carry out their ideals

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I <br /> JOINING THE LEGION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I entered the service of France in the Hotel
des Invalides, Paris, that historical structure
upon the banks of the Seine, built by Napoleon
Bonaparte as a home and refuge for his worn-out
veterans. The well-known statue of the
Man of Destiny, with three cornered hat and
folded arms, gazed broodingly upon us, as with
St. Gaudens and Tex Bondt, I marched up the
court yard.</p>

<p class='c001'>At depot headquarters, where I gave my
name and American address, a soldier, writing
at a desk, spoke up,—“Do you know Winona,
in Minnesota?” “Yes, of course, it is quite near
my home.” “Do you know this gentleman?”
He unbuttoned his vest and pulled out the photograph
of Dr. O. P. Ludwig, formerly of Winona,
now of Frazee, Minnesota.</p>

<p class='c001'>That night I was given a blanket and shown
to a room to sleep. I shall never forget what a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>cosmopolitan crew met my unsophisticated
eyes next morning. The man next to me, a
burly Swiss, had feet so swollen he could not
get his shoes on. Another had no socks. One,
wounded in the arm, sat up in bed, staring at
the newcomer. It is a habit old soldiers develop,
a polite way of expressing pity for the
newly arrived boob. An Alsatian corporal
pored over an English dictionary, trying to
learn words so he could go to the English army
as an interpreter. Suspected of being a spy, he
had been brought back from the front. These
men had slept in their clothes. The air was
foul, stifling. A soldier went about and gave
each man his breakfast—a cup of black coffee.</p>

<p class='c001'>I stuck around, wondering if I had lost my
number. Suddenly a voice, in English, boomed
out, “Hello, where’s that new Englishman?”
“I am not English,—I am an American.” Quick
as a shot came the answer, ”So am I! I am the
colonel’s orderly sent to take you over to your
company. A few minutes later, I was giving
the latest American news to Professor Orlinger,
formerly instructor in languages at Columbia
University, New York.</p>

<p class='c001'>The training was fierce—almost inhuman.
Men were needed badly at that time. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Germans were advancing, and would not wait,
so men were sent out to the front as quickly as
hardened. A number, possibly five per cent,
broke under the strain. It was a survival of the
fittest. We stuck it out; and, after eight weeks,
went to the front with the Second Regiment of
the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p class='c001'>No other nation in the world has a fighting
force like the Foreign Legion. Here, in this
finest unit in France, the real red blood of all
peoples unites. Men from fifty-three countries,
every land and clime, all ranks and walks of life,
colors, ages, professions, or different religious
and political beliefs, speaking all languages,
they have come from the four corners of the
globe and are fused in the crucible of discipline.
The Legion exacts absolute equality. The millionaire
with his wealth, or the aristocrat of
birth and pedigree, has no more privilege than
the poorest Legionnaire, who has not any.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>An outstanding type is the volunteer, well
dressed, athletic, frequently rich, who burns
with enthusiasm, and brings dash, energy and
vim, to be conserved, directed into proper channels
by the tested old timers, who are the real
nucleus of that dependability for which this
Regiment is noted. During this war, 46,672
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>men had enlisted in the Legion, of which 2,800
were on the front, autumn of 1917, when I left
for America.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Legion is a shifting panorama, international
debating ground, continuous entertainment,
inspiriting school of practical human nature.
The Legionnaire lives in realms of romance,
experiences, fantastic as are dreams,
horrible as the nightmare. He comes out, glad
to have been there, to have lived it all.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the village of repose, one will sit in a sheltered
corner by a flickering camp fire, in the
gathering darkness, not hearing the ever present
cannon’s roar, nor watching the illumination
of the distant star-shells, while Legionnaires
and volunteers tell of the Boer, Philippine,
Mexican, Spanish wars, the South American
revolutions, or describe conditions on the
Belgian Congo and in Morocco. Comrades in
the flesh recount deeds with the thrill of rollicking
adventure. The listener gets a grasp on
himself, and learns world problems.  He becomes
a divided person, one half living an unnatural
present, the other absorbed in the excitement
of yesteryear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Social life is that of the ancient buccaneer of
the Spanish Main. Here the Legionnaire finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>a kindred spirit, who shares his joys and dangers
when alive, and inherits his wealth (?)
when dead. Each shields the other in the small
incidents of life. In larger affairs all are secure
in the sheltering, comfortable traditions of the
Legion, which, insisting on strictest obedience,
provide, in return, unflinching common protection.
Never is a comrade deserted, left to the
mercies of an enemy. Death,—rather than
capture!</p>

<p class='c001'>As in the early days of the American West,
a man does not have to bring recommendation
from his priest, a bank’s letter of credit, or a
certificate of respectability, to prove his eligibility.
He is taken at his face value—“No questions
asked.” He does not impair his citizenship.
He does not swear French allegiance.
He retains his own individuality. No one pries
into his private affairs. His troubles are his.
He carries them, also his fame, without advertising.
If bad, he conceals his vices. If good,
he bears his virtues in silence. Whatever his
status in civil life, in the Legion, he is simply
a Legionnaire. This is not the place for weaklings.
Invariably they are used up in the training.
Here are only strong, independent men,
who do things, who make their mark, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>scorn the little frivolities of life, who neither
give nor ask favors.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are no roundheads in the Legion. The
most noticeable thing is squareness—square
jaws, square shoulders, square dealing of man
to man. There is a feeling of pride, of emulation,
between officers and men—a mutual respect,
that is hard to define. Officers do not
spare themselves. They do not spare their men,
nor do they neglect them. While the men are
untiring in admiration of their leaders, French
officers are equally complimentary in their appreciation,
which the following citation from
General Degoutte, Commander of the Moroccan
Division, shows,—“The folds of your banner
are not large enough to write your titles of
glory, for our foreign volunteers live and die
in the marvelous. It is to the imperishable
honor of France to have been the object of such
worship, of all the countries, and to have
grouped under her skies all the heroes of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Scores of books, in many languages, have
been written about this famous corps, some in
anger, others in sorrow, many blaming—few
praising, the hardness of the discipline, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>shortness of the food, the length of the marches,
or the meager wages of one cent per day. After
two years the pay was raised to five cents, subsequently,
and again increased to one franc (20
cents) per day, while at the front.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are many reasons why men become
Legionnaires. Some join for glory, others for
adventure. Some just want to be in the midst
of things,—they yearn to see the wheels go
round! Others were brought by curiosity,
rather than intelligence. Some came because
they wanted to—others, because they had to.
Some crave the satisfaction of helping underdogs,
who are sweating their brass collars.
Some fight for hatred of Germany and of the
German character. Others strive for love of
France and what she stands for. Different
feelings, mingled with heroic ideals, recruit the
ranks.</p>

<p class='c001'>American members know that the present
fight of France is ours. She, also, contends for
democracy. She aided us in our direst need.
In the darkest hour of the Revolution, it was
the French fleet that defied the English, landed
French soldiers to help us, and enabled Washington
to dispatch 5,000 red-breeched Frenchmen,
who marched from Newport News to join
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>1,500 American infantry under Alexander
Hamilton. They captured Yorktown and compelled
the surrender of Cornwallis and gained
the victory that resulted in the independence
of America.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, today, 142 years later, American soldiers
in khaki cross leagues of ocean, fight, suffer
and die to save France from invasion even as
France saved us.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II <br /> HISTORY OF THE LEGION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Foreign Legion has a notable record,
which extends back to the Crusades. Then,
French and Anglo-Saxon marched together,
and fought to save the world for Christianity.
History, repeating itself, after centuries, today,
we see the same forces, side by side, fighting,
dying, not only for Christianity, but for civilization.
On the result of this clash with the
barbarous Hun depends the preservation of the
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Pontevrault, twenty miles from Saumer,
in the valley of the Loire, rest the remains of
Richard Coeur-de-Lion, whose Anglo-Saxon
heart, worn with hardship and suffering, ceased
beating under the sunny skies of France,
pierced by the poisoned arrow of a mysterious
assassin from the far East.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beneath the pavement, in front of the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre, in Jerusalem, lie the remains
of Philip D’Aubigne, a French knight,
who fulfilled his vow to lay himself upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>threshold of that church which marks the place
where rests the body of our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the Anglo-Saxon perished in France, and
the Frenchman died in Jerusalem, both for the
cause of Right and Justice, today, millions leave
native land to meet that organized force, which
seeks to conquer, subdue, and enslave the people
of all earth’s free countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among ancient soldiers of the Foreign Legion
were Broglie of Broglie, Rantzan, Lowendall,
the Duke of Berwick, John Hitton, the son
of an African king, and the Scottish Stuarts,
with many other knights and men of note.</p>

<p class='c001'>For their devotion, especially that of the
Swiss Guards to the French Kings, the Legionnaires,
were respected, even by their enemies,
the Revolutionists, who, April 20, 1792, appealed
to them to “desert the cause of Royal
oppression, range themselves under the flag of
France, and consecrate their efforts to the defense
of liberty.” They responded, gathered
under the tri-color, and, in 1795, commanded by
Angereau, Marshal of France, one of Napoleon
Bonaparte’s most trusted generals, won such
renown that companies—frequently whole regiments
of foreigners—flocked to their standard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>In 1799, there were incorporated a regiment of
Italians, a regiment of Poles and a regiment
of Maltese. These made the campaign of Egypt
with Napoleon. In 1809, a Portuguese, a Greek
and an Irish regiment joined. In 1812, came a
regiment of Mamelukes, who, January 7, 1814,
had their name changed to Chasseurs of the
Orient.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Foreign Legion helped save France for
the people in the Revolution. They shared in
the glory and pomp of Napoleon’s dazzling
career. They marched and suffered through
the retreat from Moscow. Napoleon, on his return
from Elba, created eight Regiments of the
Foreign Legion, who shared the fate of the
world’s greatest soldier at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c001'>After Napoleon’s downfall Louis XVIII created
the Royal Foreign Legion which later became
merged into the 86th Regiment of the
Line.</p>

<p class='c001'>May 9th, 1831, the French Chamber of Deputies
decreed the Foreign Legion should not be
employed on the soil of France, so the Regiment
was sent to Africa, with headquarters at
Sidi-bel-Abee’s, Algeria.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1842 Patrick MacMahon, a descendant of
Irish kings, was lieutenant colonel of the Foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Legion. Later, during the Crimean War,
MacMahon’s troops were assigned the task of
capturing the Malikoff. After hours of hand-to-hand,
sanguinary fighting, to beat off the
Russian counter-attacks, the French commander,
Marshal Pellisser, believing the fortress
was mined, sent MacMahon orders to retire.
The old Legionnaire replied,—“I will hold my
ground, dead or alive.” He held. The evacuation
of Sebastopol followed. In 1859, he defeated
the Austrians at Magenta. He was
given the title of Duke of Magenta, and rewarded
with the baton of a Marshal of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1854, Bazaine, who enlisted as a private
soldier in the 37th Regiment of the Line, and
died a Marshal of France, was Colonel of the
Foreign Legion. He led them to Milianah,
Kabylia and Morocco.</p>

<p class='c001'>They participated in the Mexican War, in
1861, and in the Franco-German War of 1870,
after the fall of Sedan, and the capture of Napoleon
III, under the Republic; they served
with General Garibaldi, “The Liberator of
Italy.” Three brigades of the Foreign Legion,
chiefly Irishmen, Spaniards, Italians and Franc-Tireurs,
fought a bitter partisan warfare
against overwhelming odds in eastern France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and the Vosges, where, rather than surrender
to the invader, many crossed the frontier into
Switzerland.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Casablanca, Africa, in 1908, a dispute
about a German, enlisted in the Foreign Legion,
almost precipitated war between Germany and
France. The Kaiser rattled the saber, demanding
an apology from France; but the response
of M. Clemenceau, who stood firm, was so direct
and spirited that Germany did not then
insist. The day had not arrived. In the same
town, seven years later, January 28, 1915, a
German spy, Karl Fricke, after failing to provoke
a holy war among the Mohammedans,
relying on his personal friendship with his master,
the Kaiser, laughed when the French commander
told him he would be shot in an hour.
“You French are good jokers,” he said, and
asked for breakfast. Half an hour later, when
told to get ready for execution, he protested.
“You are carrying the thing too far, you forget
who I am.” The officer responded,—“On the
contrary, we know who you are; we remember
quite well—only too well.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1913 Lieut. Von Forstner of the 91st German
Regiment used abusive language and insulted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the French flag, while warning the Alsatian
conscripts against listening to French
agents, who the Germans claimed were inducing
men to join the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p class='c001'>On Nov. 29, 1913, at Severne near the Rhine-Marne
Canal, the civilians assembled in protest.
The soldiers charged the crowd, arrested the
Mayor, two judges, and a dozen other prominent
citizens; who in response to the universal
demand of the population were later released,—while
the officers responsible for the outrage
were court-martialed and acquitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>A short time afterward Lieut. Von Forstner
had a dispute with a lame shoemaker and cut
him down with his sword.</p>

<p class='c001'>This brutal act resulted in the officer being
again court-martialed for wounding an unarmed
civilian. Sentenced to a year’s imprisonment,
said sentence was annulled by a higher
court, who claimed that he acted in “supposed
self defense.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The demand for justice caused by the injustice
of the decision was so loud and threatening
that the Reichstag was compelled to investigate
the matter. For the first time in the German
Empire a vote of censure was passed on
the Government, 293 to 54.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>This vote, which challenged the supremacy
of the military dynasty, together with the refusal
of the Social Democrats in the Reichstag
to stand up and cheer the Kaiser, was one of the
determining factors that helped bring on the
war.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the spring of 1915 the Foreign Legion in
Europe consisted of four regiments. In November,
the small nucleus gathered about the
1st Regiment was all that remained of those
splendid men.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 2nd Regiment, after passing the winter
of 1914-15 at Croanelle in front of Croane, went
into the Champagne attack, September 25,
1915, with 3,200. October 28th but 825 survived.
These were merged into the 1st Regiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 3rd Regiment, officered by Parisian firemen,
had a very brief and sanguinary existence,
and later were merged into the 1st Regiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 4th Regiment, the Garibaldeans, 4,000
strong, after a famous bayonet attack in Argonne,
captured three lines of trenches, losing
half their effectives, including the two Garibaldi
brothers, Bruno and Peppino. The survivors
went to Italy to aid their own country,
upon her entry into the war.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Many English, Russians, Italians, Belgians
went home during that summer.  When Legionnaires
marched inside the long range of
heavy German guns, with attacks and counter-attacking
machine gun emplacements, with
wire entanglements in front, which, owing to
shortage of artillery, could not be blown up or
destroyed, but must be hand-cut, or crawled
through, is it any wonder they were scattered?
Killed, missing, the hillsides were dotted with
their graves; their wounded were in every hospital.</p>

<p class='c001'>During this last generation, the Foreign Legion
made history in the sand-swept plains of
the Sahara and in the spice-laden Isle of Madagascar.
They marched to Peking during the
Boxer troubles; fought against the pig-tails in
Indo-China, and the women warriors of Dahomey.
They have been in every general attack
of the present great war.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advancing steadily, fighting side by side
with the magnificent French Regiments who
regard the Legion with respect, almost with
jealousy,—the Legionnaire feels himself a personage.
His comrades have suffered and died
by thousands to gain the position the Regiment
holds. Each living member must now maintain
that enviable record.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>July 14, 1917, anniversary of the fall of the
Bastile, Independence Day of France, the Foreign
Legion was decorated with the braided
cord, the Fouragere, the color of the Medaille
Militaire, by President Poincare. The only
other regiment permitted to wear that decoration

<p class='c001'>During the attack on the Bois Sabot, September
28, 1915, a captured German exclaimed:
“Ha, ha, La Legion, you are in for it now. The
Germans knew you were to attack; they swore
to exterminate you. Look out. Go carefully.
Believe me, I know. I am an old Legionnaire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Previous to this, Germany, incensed by the
thousands of Alsatians and Lorraines in the Legion,
whom German law practically claims as
deserters from that country, served notice that
any captured Legionnaire would be shot. So
the Legionnaires hang together. They stay by
one another. They never leave wounded comrades
behind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans promised no mercy. The Legion
adopted the motto: “Without fear and
without pity,” and on the flag is written,
“Valor and Discipline.” The march of the Foreign
Legion, roughly interpreted, reads:</p>

<p>FOURAGERE OF THE FOREIGN LEGION</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In Artois, after the Legion attacked and captured
three lines of German trenches, in 1915,
a captured officer, interviewed by the Colonel
of the Legion, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never have we been attacked with such wild
ferocity. Who are those white savages you
turned loose upon us?”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III <br /> AMERICANS IN THE LEGION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The world’s one organization which, for a
century, has offered refuge to any man, no matter
what nor whence, who wished to drop out of
human sight and ken, does not, for obvious
reasons, maintain a regular hotel register and
publish arrivals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Records of the Foreign Legion are open to
no one. This picturesque aggregation of dare-devil
warriors neither supports nor invites staff
correspondents. Even the names used by the
gentlemen present do not, necessarily, have any
particular significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The American was a new element in this
polyglot assembly. If there is anything he excelled
in, it was disobedience. Independence
and servility do not go hand-in-hand. He considered
himself just as good as anyone placed
in authority over him. He knew that he must
obey orders to obtain results, that obedience
was the essence of good team work; but he
wanted no more orders than were necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>He was willing they should be neutral,—who
had not the courage to stand up for their convictions.
His conscience had demanded that
he put himself on the side of Right. Always
courteous to strangers, Americans would dispute
and wrangle among themselves. They had
a never-failing appetite, also a peculiar habit of
cooking chocolate in odd corners,—contrary to
orders. They never would patch their clothes.
They did no fatigue duty they could dodge.
They carried grenades in one pocket and books
in another, and only saluted officers when the
sweet notion moved them.</p>

<p class='c001'>A corporal, who, for obvious reasons,
changed from Battalion C to Battalion G,
speaking of early days said: “The Americans
were the dirtiest, lousiest, meanest soldiers we
had. They would crawl into their dugout, roll
into their blanket; and, when I went to call
them for duty, the language they used would
burn a man up, if it came true. Yes,” he continued,
“one night I heard an awful noise down
the trench;—it was bitter cold and sound traveled
far, so I hurried on to see what was wrong.
A little snot from New York was making all
the racket. He jumped up and down, trying
to keep warm, his feet keeping time to his chattering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>teeth, till he wore a hole through the
snow to solid footing. Every time he jumped,
his loaded rifle hit the ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You fool, don’t you know that thing will go
off?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t I know. Of course I know. What
do I care? Do you know what happened in
Section 2 last week, when a gun went off?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It accidentally killed a corporal!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The officers, however, noticed, after the first
shock of misery and suffering, that they pulled
themselves together, tightened their belts and
made no complaint. On the rifle range, they
held the record. On route march, they were
never known to fall out. In patrol work, between
the lines, others would get all shot up
and never come back. The Americans always
got there; always returned; if shot up, they
brought back their comrades. They were soon
looked upon with respect and pride. They
learned faith in their officers. The officers, in
turn, found them dependable.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was customary for visiting officers to ask
to see the Americans. When so ordered, this
aggregation of automobile racers, elephant
hunters, college students, gentlemen of leisure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>professional boxers, baseball players, lawyers,
authors, artists, poets and philosophers, were
trotted out, and stood silently in line, while
Sergeant Morlae, his head on one side, extending
his finger with the diamond on would say,—“These
are the Americans, mon General.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Did they like it? They did not. They were
unable to vent their rage on the general; but
they did on Morlae. True, he had made soldiers
of them, in spite of themselves. He had
shamed, bluffed, bullied, scolded them into
being soldiers. They did not mind that. They
knew it had to be. But, being placed on exhibition
got their goat.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, each man carved out his own particular
block and put his mark thereon. Strong
characters, they cannot be passed over living,
or forgotten dead. M. Viviani said, at Washington:—“Not
only has America poured out
her gold, but her children have shed their blood
for France. The sacred names of America’s
dead remain engraved in our hearts.”</p>

<p>EIGHT AMERICANS OF THE LEGION<br />(Taken on the Summit of Ballon d’Alsace, August, 1915)<br /><br />Left to right—Zinn, wounded; Seeger, killed; Narutz, killed; Bowe, wounded; Bouligny, wounded three times; Dowd, killed; Scanlon, wounded; Nilson, killed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><b>Denis Dowd</b>, of New York City, and Long
Island, a graduate of Columbia University, and
of Georgetown, District of Columbia, a lawyer
by profession, of Irish descent, a fine soldier,
passed the first year in the trenches and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>wounded October 19, 1915. We were in the
same squad—were wounded different days—again
met in same hospital. While in hospital,
he received a package from the ladies of the
American Church of the Rue de Berri, Paris,
in which was a letter. This was followed by
correspondence, later a daily correspondence.
Then came an invitation to pass his furlough
with new found friends. Inside of twenty-four
hours after meeting, this hard-headed lawyer
was affianced to the lady, daughter of a professor
at the Sorbonne. He entered, for the
study of aviation, the Buc Aviation School,
and stood at the head of a class of fifteen aspirants.
While making a preliminary flight,
previous to obtaining his brevet, he was killed,
August 11, 1916. In life he showed a contempt
of danger. He passed away with a smile on
his lips. His body was buried at Asnieres,
near St. Germain.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>D. W. King</b>, Providence, R. I., member of a
family connected with cement products interests
in England and America, a Harvard graduate—of
uncomplaining and unflinching disposition,
though small in stature, he was great
in courage. I have seen him marching without
a whimper when his feet were so sore that only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the toes of one foot could touch the ground.
He always had an extra cake or two of chocolate,
and was willing to divide with the individual
who could furnish fire or water. He
changed from the Foreign Legion to the 170th,
in 1915, and was seriously wounded in 1916.
On recovery he went into the Aviation.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Edgar Bouligny</b>, a real American from New
Orleans, Louisiana, had served two enlistments
in the U. S. Army. His father was minister
to Mexico, and during the civil war threw
himself on the side of Human Liberty, as the
son, later, put in his fortune and health for
International freedom. He went from Alaska
to France. He rose to be sergeant in the Foreign
Legion. He was three times wounded,
then transferred to the Aviation. Obtaining
his brevet in three months, he went to Salonica,
Albania, Greece and the Balkans. He was
decorated with the Croix de Guerre, with silver
star, in January, 1917.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>J. J. Casey</b>, a cartoonist from San Francisco,
California, went into the Foreign Legion in the
early days and is still going strong. Naturally
of a quiet disposition, he will fight at the drop
of the hat, on provocation. He was shot in
the foot on September 25, 1915, was in the hospital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of the Union de Femmes of France at
Nice and went back to the front, where he still
remains.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Arthur Barry</b>, Boston, Massachusetts, formerly
a gunner on U. S. battleship Dakota, now
acts as an Irish battleship ashore and throws
grenades on the dry land Boche, whenever an
opportunity occurs,—of a happy, devil-may-care
disposition, all work is a lark to him, while
growling and his temperament are total strangers.
Twice wounded, the last time I saw
him was in hospital at Lyons, where he was
waiting till a shell splinter could be extracted.
He had already decided that he would go direct
to the front instead of to the regimental depot
on recovery. He was decorated for bravery at
Chalons, July 14, 1917. Was later transferred
to the American Engineers, wearing the red
fouragere of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>James J. Back</b>, an engineer by profession,
who spoke French fluently, went from the Foreign
Legion to the Aviation in the early part of
1915. It was announced in “La France,” Bordeaux,
September 2, 1917, that he was taken
prisoner by the Boche. When his machine
broke, he fell inside the German lines. He was
taken before a court martial, charged twice with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>being a Franc-tireur American, which called
for the death penalty; but was twice acquitted.
He still languishes in prison. The published
account is true; but it did not mention that the
news was over two years old.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bob Scanlon</b>, professional boxer, soldier of
the Legion, kept having narrow escapes from
death so often that he became a mascot of good
luck. In civilian life he had whipped Mar-Robert,
Marthenon, and Joe Choynski—even
the Boche shells respected him! He changed
from the Foreign Legion into the 170th, then
went into the machine gun company. He lost
his good luck. He found a piece of shell which
ripped him up badly. Two years later, in September,
1917, in Bordeaux, coming back to his
old gait, he gave a boxing exhibition with Lurline,
the French Champion.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Laurence Scanlon</b>, wounded in the Foreign
Legion, went into Aviation, dropped his aeroplane
through, and into, a cook-house. His
captain running, expecting to find a corpse, met
Scanlon coming out of the door, who saluted
and reported himself present,—“It is I, mon
capitaine, just arrived.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>John Brown</b>, American citizen, got mixed up
with a shell explosion in the September attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>in Champagne, in 1915. All his comrades were
killed; but this tough nut has just been blown
about till he is bent double and one eye is almost
gone. He has been in eleven hospitals
during twenty-three months. In August, 1917,
he was ordered to go to regimental depot for
two months “Inapt.” The regimental doctors
gave him an examination, then sent him back
to hospital.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>F. Capdevielle</b>, New Yorker, splendid fellow,
after a year in the Foreign Legion changed to
the 170th, where he rose to be sergeant. But
a young man, he has a great record for longevity,
having been through the successive attacks
of the two regiments volonté, without
receiving a scratch, though he was used up
physically in the spring of 1917, and put in a
couple of months recuperating in Paris. He
was decorated for gallantry, at Verdun, in the
spring of 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Tony Pollet</b>, champion boxer, from Corona,
New York, came to America with his parents,
had his first papers—was the tallest, best-built
man in his company—a terror on wrong
doers—in social life as gentle as a woman.
The boxing match between him and Bob
Scanlon at Auxelle Bas, Alsace, will pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>down in the traditions of the Legion for all
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later Tony whipped the three cooks. He
was put in charge of the kitchen for punishment;
but he got into disgrace again because
the Legionnaires caught a pet cat, skinned it
and threw it into the soup.</p>

<p class='c001'>Living on his income of one cent a day, as
he had no money, too proud to expose his financial
condition, he did not go to Paris, July 4,
1915, but suffered his martyrdom in silence.
Wounded in Champagne in 1915, also on the
Somme in 1916, when permission came for a
furlough in America, he had forty-two cents.
He stowed away on a Trans-Atlantic steamer
to New York, where the authorities claimed,
he was not an American. If he had declared
his intention to be an American, he had lost the
evidence of it. So they locked him up two days
at Ellis Island.</p>

<p class='c001'>When in hospital one night, he stole out to
see his girl, caught, and standing before the
medical board, who threatened to revoke his
convalescence, he replied hotly—“You do that,
and I will make you more trouble than you can
shake off the rest of your life. You must not
think you are handling a Legionnaire from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Africa now;—I will show you what a real
American Legionnaire can do!” The old
Colonel, a judge of men, spoke up;—“Silence
yourself. Attention, eyes front, about face,
forward march.” Tony walked away; but he
got his furlough.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>George Peixotto</b>, painter by profession,
brother of the President of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Paris, joined the Foreign
Legion and was detailed to the 22nd artillery.
Now, instead of making life-like figures, he
makes figures lifeless!</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bullard.</b> After the Champagne attack, in
1915, was changed from the Legion to the
170th, then again into the Aviation. A busy
man, he managed to dodge the Boche bouquets,
and, so far, he has kept right side up with care.
Always likes to have Old Glory in sight.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bob Soubiron</b>, in civil life a racing automobilist,
former racing partner of Ralph de Palma.
After a year of active service with the
Legion, he was wounded in the knee and evacuated.
He concluded that was too slow. So, in
order to get a touch of high life, he went into
the Aviation. He was decorated for bravery
with the following citation:—“Soubiron, an
American, engaged in the French service since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the beginning of the war,—member of the Foreign
Legion, took part in battle of the Aisne,
in 1914, and the attack in Champagne, in 1915;—wounded
October 19, 1915, entered Aviation,
and proved a remarkable pilot—forced an enemy
to fall in October when protecting aviators
who were attacking an enemy’s observation
balloon.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Lincoln Chatcoff</b>, Brooklyn, New York, one
of the old originals, went from the Legion into
Aviation and was decorated with the Croix de
Guerre. Unable to get permission to go to
England, he demanded a pass to Paris. He
went to the Minister of War’s office, explained
his case, and said,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, I want to know the truth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whether I am a Legionnaire or an Aviator?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You look like an Aviator.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, am I one or not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must be one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Am I one or not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I demand to be treated as one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you want now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Permission to go to England.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>He got it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He became an expert in his line. He used to
take his old friends up in the air, ask them if
they had been to confession, or had said their
prayers, then turn a double somersault, finish
with an Egyptian side wiggle and land his victims,
gasping for breath. On June 15, 1917,
he had aloft an American ambulance man, who
was killed by the process. Chatcoff, himself,
was sent to the hospital for repairs.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Kroegh</b> was in the Legion the first year. He
went down with the boys to the Fourth of July
wake in Paris. Then he went to Norway,
when he organized and brought back a detachment
of Norwegian Ski-runners, who hauled
provisions and wounded men over the snow-clad
hills of the Vosges in the winter of 1915-1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Eugene Jacobs</b>, from Pawtucket, Rhode
Island, went from the Legion to the 170th,
where he became one of the best liked sergeants.
He was decorated with the Croix de
Guerre for bravery. A butcher by trade, he
now carries a carving knife on the end of his
rifle.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Barriere</b> was killed at la Cote. His little
brother, Pierre, 15 years old, who had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>from America to be as near him as possible,
was working at the American Express Company’s
office at the Rue d’Opera, Paris, when
the bad news came. He quit his good situation,
stopped correspondence with all friends, and
lived through his grief silently and alone, like
the little man he is.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>John Laurent</b>, a quiet, gentlemanly man,
was in the Legion till October 12th, 1915, when
he changed into the 170th. An actor in civil
life, he became a real, living actor in the most
stupendous drama ever staged. He plays his
part to perfection.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Collins</b>, writer and journalist, passed the first
year of the war in the trenches of France.
Evacuated for inspection, the next we heard
of him was from the Balkans. Wounded, he
turned up in Paris for convalescence. Then,
back to the French front. He became such a
truthful and realistic writer, through actual
experience, that the censor cut out the half of
the last article he wrote to the New York Herald;
and the public hears from him no more.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Charles Trinkard</b>, Brooklyn, went through
the Croanelle and Campaigne affairs with the
Foreign Legion. He was wounded in Champagne
September 25, 1915. Afterwards he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>joined the Aviation, and was killed in combat,
November 29, 1917. His machine fell into a
village occupied by the Legion. A few minutes
after his death permission arrived allowing
him, after three years’ service, to visit his
American home.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Charles S. Sweeney</b>, a West Pointer, rose in
the Legion successively to corporal, sergeant,
lieutenant and captain. He was wounded in
the head in 1915. Decorated with the Legion
of Honor and Croix de Guerre, he returned to
America. On the declaration of war, he became
a major in the American Army and drilled
rookies at Ft. Meyer, Va. He carried the colors
that enwrapped O’Connel’s coffin—the
Stars and Stripes, and the Tri-color, to the latter’s
home at Carthage, Mo.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Mouvet</b>, San Francisco, Cal., brother of M.
Maurice and Florence Walton, the dancers,
joined the Legion, August, 1915. He was
wounded, also, decorated with the Croix de
Guerre, July 4, 1916. He served five months in
the Aviation, then returned to the Legion; and
in December, 1917, was again seriously
wounded.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Prof. Orlinger</b>, Columbia University, New
York City, put in the first winter in Croanelle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>changed to the 167th, wounded and invalided
home. Short of stature, the long strides he
made on march, to keep step, were an additional
attraction in the ever-interesting adventure.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Algernon Sartoris</b>, son of Nellie Grant,
daughter of General U. S. Grant, former President
of the United States, serves at present in
the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Paul Pavelka</b>, Madison, Conn., an old timer,
bound up Kiffin Rockwell’s bayonet wound at
Arras, May 9, 1915.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was his section that started the attack on
the Bois de Sabot in Champagne in 1915. Orders
came to reconnoitre the Boche position.
Everybody knew that these trenches were German.
They could see the rifles of the soldiers
over the trench tops. Musgrave said, “Let’s
go see what in hell sort of a show they have
over there.” The section, about forty men,
went and just two, Pavelka and Musgrave, both
Americans, came back. After fourteen months
in the trenches, he changed to the Aviation.
He, a splendid marksman, put twelve bullets,
out of twelve shots, into a moving target at one
hundred yards. Killed near Monastir, November
1, 1917, he was buried at Salonica.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><b>Frank Musgrave</b>, San Antonio lawyer, a
long-limbed raw-boned Texan, not only looks
the part but acts it. Original as they make
them, even in original states. It was a joy to
meet such a character. After dodging death
in Champagne, he changed into the 170th and
at Verdun was captured in the spring of 1916
by the Boche, during an attack. He is now a
prisoner in Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Frank J. Baylies</b>, New Bedford, Mass., drove
ambulance in Serbia in 1916. Went into the
French Aviation. At Lufberry’s death, he became
the leading American Ace and was himself
killed June 17, 1918. The news of how he
was shot down in combat with German aviators,
and went to his death among the flames
of his machine on German soil, was brought in
a letter dropped by an enemy pilot. He brought
down 11 Boche machines, was promoted to
lieutenant, and decorated with the Legion of
Honor.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>David E. Putnam</b>,<a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c015'><sup>[B]</sup></a> Brookline, Mass. Putnam
succeeded Baylies as chief American Ace with
12 Boche machines to his credit. In the month

<p class='c001'><b>Cyrus Chamberlain</b>, Minneapolis, Minn.
Killed in combat while he and a Frenchman
were fighting twelve German aviators. Odds
6 to 1. Though he lost his life, he gained the

his blood to cement the tie that binds the two
Republics.  Decorated with the Croix de
Guerre. Buried at Coulommiers.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Harold E. Wright.</b> Along with others had
much trouble getting discharged from the
French army. June 6, 1918, was ordered to
Paris to be transferred to American Army. No

French Minister of Aeronautics for information.
Was told to report to the Commander
of the Fourth Army at the Front, where he
was arrested as a deserter, and ordered to be
shot at sunrise. Friends interceded, and he
was ordered to report at the Bureau of Recruitment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Paris, where he received his discharge
from the French Army, dated January 21, several
days before he was sentenced to be shot.
Again arrested on orders of the Prefect of Police,
an examination of his papers resulted in
him being catalogued with the U. S. Army.
Provost Marshal receipted for him like a bale

<p class='c001'><b>Manual Moyet</b>, Alabama. American Legionnaire,
wounded near Soissons, May, 1918.
Three times cited for bravery. Last citation:
“Legionnaire Manual Moyet, during the Vilers-Bretioneaus
combat, withstood effectively
with his automatic rifle, the enemy machine
guns, deciding the progress of his section.
Afterwards he broke up several counter attacks
along the front.” He wrote from a hospital
bed to a friend, “Believe me, I am sure that
after the war it is going to be the greatest honor
to have served in the Foreign Legion. I am
getting better and hope to be ready for duty
in a month. As I grow older I understand
things better and better; we are not fighting
for fun, but for liberty. After you have killed
two or three Boches you do not mind dying.
The spirit of the Legion is wonderful, although
many of the most famous of the legionnaires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>are dead. Should I live to be a hundred years
I shall never forget a man from my section who,
mortally wounded, lay between the lines shouting,
‘Vive la France, Vive la Legion I die, but
I am satisfied to die for Liberty.’”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Elof Nelson</b>, a real, quiet, pleasant man,

<p class='c001'><b>George Marquet</b>, New York, three times
wounded—the last time on July 1, 1916, at Hill
304, near Verdun. This company, the 8th of
the 6th Regt. of the Line, while defending the

that I will not go at all.” His great-grandfather
had fought in Egypt. The grandson,
following the old man’s footsteps, rose to the

Croix de Guerre and, later, detailed to America
to instruct the growing army in artillery observation.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Mjojlo Milkovich</b>, of San Francisco, Cal., a
professional boxer, left the Golden West with

He was torpedoed in the “Brindisti” and, after
five hours in the water, reached shore, naked as
the day he was born. At Corfu, Greece, he
joined the French Army, was wounded on the
Bulgarian front and tended in the Scottish
Woman’s Hospital at Salonica. After his recovery
he went direct to the front, and, again
severely wounded, was sent to France. At
quarters one day he accosted me:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, you understand English?” “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So am I,—can’t speak a word of French.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The three main cords of his leg were severed
by shell splinters. He chafed at the slow hospital
life, and, every second day, he pounded
the doctors on the back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why don’t you let me go back to America?
You have got my leg, you know I can never
march again. Why don’t you let me go home?”
He was decorated with the Croix de Guerre,
with the following citation: “A very good soldier,
seriously wounded, advancing resolutely
to attack a village very strongly fortified.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I asked him what he saw down in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw enough—so that I’ll never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Milton Wright</b>, an American citizen, born of
American parents, went from Philadelphia to
France on a four-masted ship. On shore, without
a passport, was arrested by the gendarmes,
who communicated with his captain, who replied:
“We don’t want him. He is a German
spy.” So he was in prison four or five months.
He was then told he could go into the Foreign
Legion for the period of the war. He did not
understand, as he could not speak French. The
French officials did not speak English. He was
signed up for five years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The skipper owed him for several weeks’
wages. His going left an opening to take back
Frenchmen who would give thousands of dollars
to get away and escape military service.
Wright was an innocent, honest fellow, a victim
of circumstances. But he felt he was
wronged and would not drill. Finally, after
being worried almost crazy, he was given a
railroad ticket to Boulogne, and mustered
out.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>James Ralph Doolittle</b>, of New York, started

was decorated with the Croix de Guerre, with
palm. He was a splendid fellow, good soldier
and a gentleman. He was three times
wounded. The last time he dropped 600 feet,
breaking an ankle and seriously disfiguring his
face. He passed his convalescence in America,
November, 1917.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Dr. Julian A. Gehrung</b>, of the New York Eye
and Ear Infirmary, offered his services to the
then personally conducted American Ambulance.
He did not know they wanted chauffeurs
and drivers, who could be ordered about,
rather than doctors and men of established
reputation who could run their own affairs.
So, he, known in America from coast to coast,
was snubbed. March 24, 1917, he was offered
by the French Government, the supervision
of a large hospital. Accidentally meeting an
American soldier of the Legion, a French officer
came along, patted him on the back and
said, “Ha, ha, you have got a fine appointment.
You have found a compatriot. You are now
satisfied.” Quick as a shot, the answer came
back, “No, I am not satisfied, I want to be sent
to the front.”</p>

with the Croix de Guerre for having alone, with
grenades, stopped a night attack at Bellay-en-Santerre,
in July, 1916. He was killed by a
treacherous prisoner, whose life he had spared.
Having killed the Germans in that dugout, excepting
this prisoner, who threw up his hands
and cried “Kamrad,” Paul started to run to
the next dugout, when the German grabbed
a rifle and shot him in the back through the

unslung his knapsack en route, who tented
alone, who never bent the body or dodged a

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div><b>”American Veterans in France.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c018'>“April 28, 1917.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Sir:—May I ask through your columns why
it is that those few Americans, brave enough
to seek voluntarily, while their country was
still neutral, the ranks, of our army, have not
yet been claimed by their own Government,
whose citizens they remain, while all at home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>are apparently receiving commissions and
honor, are these men to remain sergeants and
soldiers in the French Army, unrecognized and
unhonored by their mother country?</p>

<p class='c001'>“To me, their part was such a beautiful one,
to leave home and luxury and peace for this
carnage to follow their ideals, to risk death voluntarily,
if it aid their friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely, your people cannot understand how
deeply the spirit of those boys has touched the
hearts of French women in these trying times.
And, now that the spirit of your people has
risen to their side, are these leaders to be forgotten?</p>

<p class='c001'>“The two aviators, Genet and Hoskier, who
have died since April 3, were in French uniform.
Frenchmen respect them; do not Americans?</p>

<div class='c019'>A French Mother.”</div>

<p class='c014'>The Continental edition of the New York
Herald is not a mail order catalogue, or a political
organ, it is a real newspaper, and the
only American journal published in France.
It is well printed on good paper. It records the
doings of society. Its columns are open to the
opinions of others. It publishes the most cutting
criticism of its own policy with the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of pleasure. It prints every appeal for charity—from
humans to cats.</p>

<p class='c001'>It fought for International Honesty, when
leaders and trimmers were silent. When the
leaders woke up, it pushed. Its accurate information,
often suppressed by the censor, makes
every blank space an honor mark. While the
editor, like the petite Parisienne, whose demure
eyes cannot conceal the lurking mischief within,
just writes enough editorially to make the
reader wish for more.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its vigorous American attitude in 1915 and
1916 gave the French people hope. It gave the
repatriated American comfort, for it strengthened
his convictions. He felt better for knowing
that some, at least, of his countrymen had
the courage to stand up for the cause he was
willing to die for. So, he went forward cheerfully.
He knew he was following the right path
and he was not alone. The Herald gave him
comfort. It sustained him in adversity.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV <br /> FIRST AMERICAN FLAG IN FRANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Americans in the Legion came and went.
Singly or in groups they went wounded into
hospitals, prisoners into Germany. Dead they
took the western trail to eternity. Missing they
disappeared into oblivion. A few were permitted
to exchange into French Regiments, where,
mothered by France, they were welcomed as
her own.</p>

<p class='c001'>August 21, 1914, in the court yard of the
Hotel des Invalides, occurred that grand mobilization
of foreigners, who, in admiration for
France, placed their lives at her disposal.
Grouped together, each under a separate standard,
these cast the vote of inspiring constituents,
lovers of freedom, back home.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day, the American volunteers assembled
at No. 11 Rue de Valois, and had breakfast
through the courtesy of M. Georges Casmeze
at the Café de la Regence. Starting out
from the Palace Royale in the Latin Quarter,
that corner of old Paris where, in by-gone days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Camille Desmoulins jumped on a chair and
made the speech that started the French Revolution,
these latter day revolters against the
“Divine Right of Kings” and absolute monarchism
began the greatest venture the world has
ever known.</p>

<p class='c001'>The volunteers marched through the Place
de l’Opera, Phelizot carrying high and proudly
the Stars and Stripes, which received a great
ovation en route. Thence to the Gare St. Lazare,
to Rouen, where they met retreating English
soldiers, many wounded and utterly exhausted.
Thence to Toulouse, whence, after a
very brief training, they were sent to the front.</p>

<p class='c014'>February, 1915, in the village of repose there
occurred one of those lamentable misunderstandings,
which, in spite of official far-sightedness,
occasionally happen in the best regulated
organizations. Begun in fun, it ended in
death, and almost started a civil war between
volunteers and Legionnaires.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little New Yorker commenced to chaff and
jolly a big, burly Arab, who, not understanding
American methods of joshing, thought the little
fellow was desperately in earnest; and, of
course, he got angry, as he was expected to.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>What the Arab intended to reply was that he
could whip two men like his tormenter. He
did say he could whip two Americans. Phelizot,
coming on the scene just then, overhearing
the remark, yelled,—“You can’t whip one,”
and waded in to educate the Arab.</p>

<p class='c001'>In about two minutes, the Arab had enough,
and ran among a crowd of Legionnaires for
protection. One of the Legionnaires swung a
canteen and hit Phelizot on the head, who did
not stop till he beat the Arab to the ground.
Morlae, Capdeville and other volunteers ran to
Phelizot’s aid. Legionnaires flocked from all
corners. A pitched battle seemed imminent.
An officer heard the tumult, happening along,
and separated them. The Arabs were transferred
to another battalion. The Americans
were herded into a loft, and placed under arrest;
while sentinels walked underneath, with
fixed bayonets, till the Arabs had been moved,
bag and baggage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doctor who dressed Phelizot’s wound
probably did not know the canteen was rusty.
Possibly he did not know he was hit by a canteen.
At any rate, he did not give an anti-tetanic
injection. The injured man steadily grew
worse. He was not a squealer, and insisted on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>marching in line till the pain became unbearable.
When too late, his condition was discovered.
He had contracted blood poison which
resulted in his death.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a splendid specimen of manhood, an
American first, last, all the time. A dead shot,
he was hunting elephants in Africa when the
war broke out. In spite of having a large consignment
of ivory confiscated by the Germans
in Antwerp, he donated several thousand francs
to the Belgian Relief Fund.</p>

<p class='c001'>By his untimely death, the Legion lost one
of its strongest characters, France a fine soldier
and America a good citizen. He was buried at
Ferme d’Alger. His last words, were,—“I am
an American.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The flag was carried by Phelizot until his
death. Then, Bob Soubiron wrapped it about
his own body and so kept it until he was
wounded in October, 1915. On his recovery,
February, 1916, it was taken to the Aviation,
and, July 14, 1917, presented, by Dr. Watson,
to the French Government. It was deposited
in the Hotel des Invalides along with the other
historic battle flags of France. The Minister
of War acknowledged its receipt,—“I accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>with pleasure, in the name of the French army,
this glorious emblem, for which General Noix,
Governor of the Invalides, has reserved a beautiful
place in the Hall of Honor in the Museum
of the Army.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V <br /> FOREIGNERS IN THE LEGION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Within this present generation, men like
Lord Kitchener, King Peter of Serbia, Vernof,
a Russian prince, and Albert F. Nordmann,
who died in Algeria and was reported a relative
of Kaiser Wilhelm II, belonged to this famous
corps. This chapter presents some illustrious
foreigners who have served during the present
war.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Nagar Aza</b>, son of the Persian minister to
France, decorated for bravery and three times
cited in Army Orders, again cited and decorated
for brilliant conduct at Auberieve, April
17, 1917.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Edwin Bucher</b>, a Swiss sculptor, pupil of Roden
and Bourdelle, has marked the resting
places of the Foreign Legion by carving exquisite
figures on the solid walls of everlasting
rock.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Marquis de Montesquion</b>, compelled to leave
the French Army because his Catholic soul
would not permit him to dismantle churches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>joined the Foreign Legion. On Sept. 28, 1915,
when acting as Lieutenant in Battalion G, 2nd
Legion, he saw a German white flag projecting
from the enemy’s position. He went over with
eight men to take possession and all were shot
down by the treacherous enemy and killed.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>M. Lobedef</b>, a Russian, promoted to lieutenant
in 1915. He later returned to Russia and
became Minister of Marine.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Abel Djebelis</b>, a Maltese, winner of the Marathon
race between Windsor and London, England,
June, 1914. He was wounded at Champagne
in 1915 and on the Somme in 1916, by
two bullets each time. While waiting to be
mustered out at Lyons, July, 1917, he entered
a race under the name of Marius, and won from
twenty competitors. Discharged for disability.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>M. Valsamakis</b>, a Greek, rose to a lieutenancy
in the Legion and was decorated with the Legion
of Honor. He returned home and was arrested
in Athens for participating in the street
riots of December, 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Piechkoff Gorky</b>, Russian, son of Maxim
Gorky, the novelist, had an arm blown away by
a shell. He received the Legion of Honor for
bravery and is now attached to the Russian
Mission in France.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><b>Bruno and Peppino Garibaldi</b>, Italians, sons
of an illustrious father, killed in bayonet attack
in Artois, spring of 1915. French admirers
have had their profiles, in a medal, fitted into
the statue of Garibaldi in the Square Lowendal,
Paris. The square is named for one Legionnaire,
the statue is built for another.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Eilyaken</b>, an Egyptian, was attending the
Conservatory of Music at Brussels when the
war broke out. A natural born actor, he burlesqued
the military system of the Legion so
accurately that the sous-officers managed
to keep him in prison in order to silence his cutting
sarcasm. He was shot, square through
both cheek bones, in the Champagne attack, in
1915, and carried to shelter on the back of an
officer. Mustered out in 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>An East Indian</b>, name unknown, blew in, like
a blaze of glory, between two French military
policemen. He was dressed in English khaki—clothes,
leggings, spy-glass, map-book, canteen,
haversack, spurs, a brand new English rifle,
with a pocket full of 100 franc notes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is that, an English soldier?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, a civilian.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such he proved to be, a practicing physician
in London, who had equipped himself, and arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>at the little village where the Legion was
in repose. A stout man, the officer in command,
addressed the East Indian,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why don’t you report yourself at headquarters?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How can I report myself, till I can find the
place to report?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why don’t you report to your superior officer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t report to him till I can find him, can
I?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t you know I am your superior officer;—why
don’t you salute?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you are, consider yourself saluted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Major roared out, in disgust,—“Here,
sergeant, take this fool to prison.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>De Chamer</b>, Swiss, a major in the Swiss National
Army, fought his way up in the Legion
from a private to a captaincy. The Swiss residents
of Paris showed appreciation of their
countrymen in the service of France by inviting
them to a banquet held in the Palais d’Orsay,
on Independence Day, Aug. 1, 1917.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Emery</b>, Swiss, a student of Oxford University,
England, outspoken, independent and intelligent—a
good comrade, was killed on the
Somme, July, 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><b>Ben Azef</b>, an Arab, an Oriental priest, always
wanted water, when there was none. He would
flop onto his knees, face toward the East, and
bow his forehead to the ground. Then get up
on the trench and rail at the Germans for their
swinish propensities and ruthless rapacity.</p>

<p class='c001'>A shell dropped into his section. His comrades
threw themselves on the ground and
yelled out:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get down, you, blamed fool, you’ll get
killed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ben Azef stood majestically erect, gazed
calmly and contemplatively at the shell (fortunately
it was a dud—one which fails to explode)
and said,—“My friends, death to me is
not destruction. It is the consummation of my
material life,—the commencement of my Life
Divine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was shot dead through the heart, in 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Ch. A. Hochedlinger</b>, an educated Polish gentleman,
speaks half a dozen languages, was
twice wounded. When in hospital, he met and
married a lovely French girl from Algiers, who
now conducts his business at Bordeaux, while
he gives his services to France.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Michal Ballala</b>, an Abyssinian Prince, in spite
of his color, had the dainty figure and elegant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>bearing of a woman of fashion. He was
wounded in 1915.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Colonel Elkington</b>, of the English Royal
Warwickshire Regiment, served as a private
soldier in the Legion.  He was seriously
wounded in the attack on the Bois Sabot, Sept.
28, 1915. He was decorated with the Croix de
Guerre and Medaille Militaire.</p>

<p class='c001'>One morning, on inspection, an Alsatian
Captain of the Legion, noticing he was short a
button, said,—“No button? Four days confined
to quarters.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Elkington replied,—“Merci, mon capitaine.”
(Thank you, my captain.)</p>

<p class='c001'>On recovery from his serious wounds, he returned
to England and was reinstated in his
former rank.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Said Mousseine</b> and his two brothers, sons of
Sultan Ali of the Grand Comorres, who, being
too old to fight, sent his best beloved to aid the
country he holds so dear. Said was promoted
to corporal and transferred to the 22nd Colonials.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Augustus St. Gaudens</b>, cousin of the sculptor
who made the Adams monument in Rock Creek
cemetery, Washington, D. C., whose father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>lived near the old Academy of Design on Fourth
Avenue, New York.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another cousin of St. Gaudens, Homer, is in
charge of the 300 men in the U. S. Army, known
as the Camouflage Corps, or the army in advance
of the army.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Varma</b>,<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c015'><sup>[C]</sup></a> a Hindoo, black whiskered, silent.
Let those speculate about him who would, let
them glean what information they could.</p>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fC'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rC'>C</a>. In Aug., 1918, a man same name, same type, was arrested in
Paris by the <a id='corr103.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='gendames'>gendarmes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_103.28'><ins class='correction' title='gendames'>gendarmes</ins></a></span> for making and selling bogus diamonds.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c001'><b>M. Ariel</b>, a Turk, dealer in antiques in civil
life. He was seriously wounded on the Somme,
in 1916. I met him at Legion headquarters a
year later and found him carrying a purse made
of his own skin.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>E. Seriadis</b>, a Greek, was a Lieutenant in the
Army of Greece. He had three medals from the
Balkan wars. These he refused to wear because
King Constantine’s face disgraced them. He
was serious|y wounded in the body in 1915, and,
during the winter of 1916, all the toes of both
feet were frozen off. At the age of twenty-three,
he was mustered out—used up.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Tex Bondt</b>, a Hollander, a wonderful character,
a splendid specimen of manhood, brave
as a lion, quick as a steel trap, the only son of
a Count, with an unbroken lineage, extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>back for 800 years, his record in the Legion
would fill a book.</p>

<p class='c001'>He went out and captured two Germans single
handed. He tried to capture a third but was
discovered. He threw a grenade, and, both
sides taking alarm, started an engagement. He
was between the lines and was reported missing.
Four hours later, he reported himself
alive.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Alsace he worked and slaved to chop up a
poor peasant woman’s wood-pile—just to show
her a Hollander could keep his word.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was shot through the lungs and taken
to the hospital. Months later, reporting
at the depot, he was informed that he was
dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>When on convalescence in Paris, living on
one meal per day, he met one of France’s most
accomplished and wealthy daughters. He is
now her acknowledged suitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing him in prison one day, I asked,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are you in for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, a friend in London asked me why I
did not write about Legion life, and I responded,—‘My
dear fellow, if I wrote you all I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>about the Legion, it would make your hair
stand on end!’”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Sorenson</b>, a Dane, from Schleswig-Holstein,
formerly a policeman at St. Thomas, Danish
West Indies. He came to me holding a letter
in his hand and said,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just see here what those swine have done—they
have fined my mother a hundred marks
because she gave a crust of bread to a French
prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor fellow, the last I saw of him was on
Sept. 25, 1915, during the attack. He had been
buried by a shell—other soldiers had run over
him in the rush. After he worked through the
loose earth and freed himself, I listened to him
as in broken French, English and Danish he
apologized to the captain for the broken straps
of his knapsack and a lost gun. His round
chest was flattened out, his face dirty and
bloody, grazed by hob-nailed boots, and blood
was trickling from a round hole in his forehead.
The captain, a good sort, patted him on the
back and told him to go to the Red Cross Station.
The poor fellow staggered away and was
never heard from again.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Guimeau</b>, Mauritius Islands, a plantation
owner, of French descent, under British rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>spoke French but no English. He was an energetic
character and a valuable member of the
machine gun section.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1915, after taking several lessons in tactics,
he went to the lieutenant,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are we waiting here for? Why don’t
we go to the front?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are waiting for the guns.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many are needed for our section and
how much do they cost?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Two, at 2,000 francs each.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, here are 4,000 francs. Buy them and
let us get out where we belong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When he was about to change to the British
Army, the Colonel of the Legion, the Chief of
the Battalion and the Captain of the Company
waited for five minutes while the British Ambassador
explained to Guimeau the benefits of
changing armies. After listening to the finish
he said,—“Will you repeat that in French? I
did not understand a word you said.” Knowing
his desire to leave the Legion, his Captain
asked, why he, of French descent, speaking only
that language, should not be satisfied with his
comrades who were proud of him. He replied,—“The
British flag is the flag of my country.
It protects me. I want to protect it.” So he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>went to Great Britain, and the British, not
knowing what to do with this handy, ready Legionnaire,
sent him to school.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Dinah Salifon</b>, son of an African King from
the Soudan, Egypt, enlisted in 1914. He was
promoted to a Lieutenancy and decorated with
the Legion of Honor. He later became Commissioner
of Police at <a id='corr107.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Brazzaville?'>Brazzarville</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_107.8'><ins class='correction' title='Brazzaville?'>Brazzarville</ins></a></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Etchevarry</b>, a French convict, escaped from
French Guiana, made his way to the United
States and returned to France, under an assumed
name, to fight for his native land. He
enlisted in the Foreign Legion. He made an
enviable record. But he was recognized and
ordered to return to the penal settlement. Measures
were taken in his behalf by the Society of
the Rights of Men, in response to whose appeal
President Poincaré signed a reprieve.
Etchevarry returned to the front a free man, in
December, 1915.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Nick Korneis</b>, a Greek push-cart peddler,
who used to sell bananas at Twenty-third
Street and Avenue B, New York City, was decorated
for bravery at Verdun, with the following
citation: “Korneis, Nick, Legionnaire, 11th
Company, Foreign Legion—Elite grenadier,
who on August 20, 1917, won the admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of all his comrades by his courage and contempt
for danger. He led his comrades to the conquest
of a trench, which was defended with energy,
and which was captured along a distance
of 1,500 yards, after several hours of bloody
combat;—took single handed, numerous prisoners;—already
cited twice in Army Orders.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Rene Betrand</b>, New Jersey, was over two
years on the front, a member of the Regiment
Colonial of Morocco, which is part of the famous
19th Army Corps. He received the Croix
de Guerre for bravery, and at Douaumont,
Oct. 4, 1915, the Legion of Honor for personally
finishing off a Boche machine gun section
and bringing in the gun. That is the record,
a well built, uninjured man on board ship gave
me when I asked him how he had earned the
Legion of Honor, and why he wore the fouragere
of the Foreign Legion. In July, 1918, a
man, same name, turned up in Paris decorated
with nine medals, minus an arm and a leg,
claiming his body bore more than 30 bullet and
bayonet wounds. The gendarmes promptly arrested
him as the world’s greatest fakir, declared
he had lost the arm and leg in a railroad
accident and that five imprisonments instead of
five citations composed his record.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI <br /> ENGLISHMEN AND RUSSIANS LEAVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>About 350 Englishmen were with the Americans
in the same Battalion of the 2nd Legion.
They had enlisted when the Huns were advancing
on Paris. Common peril drew the bravest
of all countries to the front. Possibly, they
were promised later transfer to the English
Army; but, once in the Legion, they were as
nuns in a convent, to do as told, dead to the
outside world.</p>

<p class='c001'>An American writer has said, “England’s
greatest assets are patriotism and money.” He
overlooked the foundation of both—MEN, the
Englishman who dares to do and does it. He
knows his rights, and insists on them.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the Germans were driven back at the
Marne and trench conditions established, these
men demanded to be sent home to fight for
their native land. They went to the Captain,
who could not help. They went to the Colonel,
who would not. They had the British Ambassador
request their release from the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>War Department, with no better results. Ere
they were transferred, the subject was brought
up in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Just before they left, a number went to the
company captain with their breakfasts, cups of
black coffee, in their hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is this, mon capitaine?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your little breakfasts, mes enfants.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This would not keep a chipping sparrow
alive—let alone a man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You received a half loaf of bread yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, but we ate that yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I am sorry. That is the regular rations
of the French Army. I cannot change it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walking away, disgruntled, a cockney muttered
to his comrade,—“’E thinks we are
blooming canaries!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The bull-dog tactics of the persistent English
did not appeal to the officers of the Legion.
Probably the last to go were Poole and Darcy,
two powerful silent fellows, who were in hospital,
delayed by unhealed wounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Originally, there were two Darcy brothers.
While making a machine gun emplacement,
they heard a noise in front. One of the brothers
with half the detachment went out to investigate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The other stayed at work. A German
shell dropped into the emplacement and
killed, or knocked senseless, every man. Red
Cross workers, who gathered together the mutilated
and the shell-shocked Darcy, were startled
to hear some one in front. Looking around,
they saw the other Darcy drag his shattered
limbs over the edge of a shell hole. He expired,
saying, “The damned cowards ran away and
left me.” The others were all killed.</p>

<p class='c014'>In June, 1915, after six months of constant
warfare, poor food, no furloughs, cold winter
weather and scanty clothing had so brought
down the morale of the men that they didn’t
care whether they lived or not. They were absolutely
fed up to the limit on misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many Russian Jews volunteered, as had the
English, to help France. Russia later called
her subjects to the colors. Negotiations were
under way in Paris to facilitate the exchange
of Russians from the Foreign Legion to the
Russian Army. They were informed that the
Colonel had received orders to permit their return
to their native land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly, the negotiations had been completed,
perhaps not. Perhaps the Colonel was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>not officially instructed. However, the Russian
volunteers, relying on their information, when
ordered to dig trenches, refused to do so. They
demanded to be sent home. Officers argued
with them and pointed out the penalty of refusing
to obey when in front of the enemy. They
didn’t care, would not work, and could not be
forced. So ten of the ringleaders were court-martialed,
sentenced to death, taken out into
the woods near the little village of Merfy, blindfolded—shot.
Tearing the bandage from his
eyes and baring his chest to the bullet, one cried
out, “Long live France; long live the Allies, but
God damn the Foreign Legion!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Next morning the others refused to work
again,—“You have killed our brothers. Kill
us also—we are not afraid to die.” They were
not killed but were court-martialed and sentenced
to fifteen years’ penal servitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third morning, no one would work.
These cheerful fatalists said, “We are Russians—our
country calls us—we demand to go, and
you tell us go to work. We will not work. You
killed our brothers, kill us also. You may mutilate
our bodies, but you cannot crush our
souls.” These also court-martialed, were sentenced
to ten years’ penal servitude.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>There were many Russians. They showed
no disposition to yield. The load was getting
too heavy,—even for the broad shoulders of officers
of the Legion. The underground wireless
had been working. A sigh of relief went
up when a high Russian official, breast covered
with decorations, arrived from Paris. About
the same time, orders came from the French
headquarters to stop proceedings. The penal
servitude sentences were not carried out; but
they could not bring back the dead to life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inside of one month, Battalion F of the 2nd
Legion, to which the unhappy men belonged,
was merged into others. In two months, the
Russians were transferred to the Russian
Army. Four months later, the Regiment had
ceased to exist.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII <br /> TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The real, well-made, manicured trench is
from two and a half to three feet wide and eight
or ten feet deep. The narrower the trench, the
better. It gives the least space for German
shells to drop in and blow occupants out. The
more crooked the trench the better. The enemy
has smaller chance to make an enfilading (raking
lengthwise) fire. Here only are narrowness
and crookedness virtues.</p>

<p class='c001'>Each trench is embellished with channels,
mines, saps, tunnels, subterranean passages,
and bomb proof structures of various sorts. Out
in front, are from ten to fifty yards of barbed
wire entanglements, through which a Jack rabbit
could not go without getting hung up. The
German has about the same arrangement on his
side. That piece of open ground between the
German wire and the French wire is known as
“No-Man’s-Land.” In the night, patrols of men,
German and French, promenade this strip, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>guard against surprise attacks, and make observations
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Patrols often meet in conflict. Some never
come back. Others, wounded, must lie in shell
holes, awaiting an opportunity to return. At
the sign of an attack, darkness is lighted by
star shells. It is then necessary for the patrol
to get back to the wire-cut lane, or tunneled
hole under the wires where they went out, their
only refuge and chance for safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>Back of the first line trench is the second,
back of that a third. In some places, there are
a dozen lines of trenches, different distances
apart, varying with local conditions. From
the rear, at right angles, interweaving like
meshes of a net, are the communication and
auxiliary branches through which men bring
up supplies, provisions and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the front line trenches, in addition to the
infantry’s rifles and grenades, are machine guns
and trench mortars. Around the second line,
the 75’s and field artillery. About the third
line, with the reserves, stand heavy artillery.
So, when one side attacks the other, they must
cross that open “No-Man’s-Land,” go through
these barbed wire entanglements, meet the rifle
fire and grenades of the infantry, and those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>three rows of artillery. You can readily see
why the line remains stationary along the front
for so long, also how, when it has been broken
or bent, there has been such great loss of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in a bomb proof shelter of a first line
trench, in the middle of the night, at Sillery-Sur-Marne,
that I met the “American,” whose
real name was Dubois. I did not then understand
French and had been placed on guard by
a French corporal who could not speak English.
He pointed to the hole, then at the Boche
trench opposite, and walked away. The post
was well protected by sandbags and solid timbers
overhead, with an observation hole, one
inch deep by three inches wide, cut into armor
plate, in front. The usual, intermittent warfare
was in progress, and it suddenly developed
into a battle. The post was out on an
angle. Rifle clashes were all about. No one
was near in the open trench. So, getting uneasy,
I became afraid I was cut off or left
behind.</p>

<p class='c001'>I started toward the trench just as a big shell
burst there. I ducked back, concluded the sheltered
post was better than the open trench,
then glued my eye on the 1 × 3 observation hole.
Yes, no doubt, the Germans were advancing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>mass formation. I could see, through the little
hole, against the sky line, the bayonets on their
guns. A noise near my ear compelled my attention.
Then I felt and saw better. Those
bayonets were hairs, sticking straight out from
a big, fat, impudent rat, who sniffed along and
looked through the hole squarely into my eye.
I spat at the rat, which retreated a few inches,
then stopped to await developments. This
nerve angered me and I started to go outside
to throw a rock at the rodent, when a voice
behind said in English,—“Damn it, that cussed
sergeant has plugged it up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From the shelter I could see a nondescript
figure clad in an old, abbreviated bath-robe, tassels
hanging down in front, shoes unlaced, rifle
in hand, ruefully gazing at a new stack of sandbags,
which blocked a small exit into “No-Man’s-Land.”
He might have been a soldier
but he did not look it. He might have been
French, but America was stamped all over that
free-moving, powerful figure, in his quick acting,
decisive manner and set jaws, square-cut,
like a paving block.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, we two Americans, who had arrived
from different directions, each animated by
the same idea, sat down at the jumping off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>place amid those unnatural surroundings and
got acquainted.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was bizarre. The devilishness, the beauty,
alternately, shocked the feelings or soothed the
senses.  Darkness and grotesque shadows,
intermingled with colored illumination, scattering
streams of golden hail, followed by red
flame and acolytes, while sharp, white streaks
of cannon fire winked, blinked, and were lost in
the never-ending din. Between the occasional
roll of musketry and the rat-rat-tat-tat of
machine guns, we watched the pyrotechnic
display and talked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he was an American, and had been ten
months without a furlough. He had been out
in front sniping all the afternoon. That cheapskate
sergeant, who is always nosing around,
must have missed him and closed up the outlet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” he soliloquized, “the world is not fit
to live in any more. The Kaiser has mobilized
God Almighty. The Crown Prince said he
could bring the Devil from hell with his brave
German band. The Mexicans broke up my
business and destroyed my happy home. Here
in France, they made me take off my good
clothes and don these glad rags. This bath
robe is all I have left of my ancient grandeur—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>there is not much of it, but it is all wool
and a yard wide—not as long as it used to be,
but it is warm. I know it looks like hell, but it
is a sort of comfort to me, and is associated with
happier days.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” he ruminated, ”if I am not careful I
won’t have enough left to make a pocket handkerchief.
Here I have taken five or six pair
of Russian socks from it, and bandaged up
Pierre’s wound, and I only have enough for
four more pairs of socks after I have taken
some pieces to clean my rifle with.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a man of unusual history, even for
the Legion. Some months previous, seeing an
Alsatian officer strike a small man, the American
stepped up and said: “Why don’t you take
a man your own size?” For answer the officer
pulled a revolver and thrust it at his breast.
Dubois, gazing down through the eyes of the
officer, clear into his heart, said: “Shoot, damn
you, shoot. You dare not; you have not got
the nerve!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was an expert gymnast. He played the
piano, accompanying the singers at concerts,
during repose. When encored, he came back
with a song in French. In conquered Alsace,
he spoke German with the natives.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>On the day we made the 48-kilometer march
to the summit of Ballon d’Alsace and back,
while the company was resting Dubois was
striding up and down, knapsack on back,
hands in pockets. I said: “What are you
doing? Can’t you sit down and rest?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh,” he replied, “I was telling the lieutenant
that instead of poking along with these
short, fiddling steps, the men should march out
like this,—like we do in America!” It is a fact
that the French take the longest strides, and
are the best marchers in the world!</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> JULY 4, 1915</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Several American journalists, “May their
tribe increase!” among them Mr. Grundy, of
the New York Sun; Nabob Hedin, of the Brooklyn
Eagle; Mr. Mower, of the Chicago Daily
News; Mr. Roberts, of the Associated Press,
and Wythe Williams, of the New York Times,
presented a petition to the Minister of War for
the Americans to celebrate Independence Day
in Paris. It was granted. The good news
made a bigger noise on the front than the
heaviest bomb that ever fell. It did not seem
possible,—too good to be true!</p>

<p class='c001'>Previously, no one, French or foreigner,
soldier or officer, had been allowed to leave his
post. From then on, everyone received his
regular furlough at stated intervals—more
liberal as danger lessened. Now, each man is
granted ten days every four months.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_b_122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>Evening of July 3d I was on guard in front
of Fort Brimont, three kilometers from
Rheims, when Dubois put his head around a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>corner and yelled, “Come on, we are going to
Paris.” I paid no attention to him. I had not
asked for a furlough, and, of course, did not
expect any.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few minutes later Dubois roared, “Come
on, you fool, don’t you know enough to take a
furlough when you can get one? All Americans
can go to Paris.” When the corporal came
around I asked to be relieved, went to the captain
and was told we had forty-eight hours permission;
to pack up at once and go.</p>

<p class='c001'>We walked through the communication
trenches to battalion headquarters among falling
shells. These made Dubois stop and say:
“Damn it, it would just be my luck to get killed
now; I would not mind if I were coming back
from Paris, but if the Boche get me now I
shall not be able to rest in my grave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the battalion headquarters we were lined
up in the darkness. An officer with a flashlight
read off the names. Each man stepped out and
received his furlough as his name was called.
The officer stopped reading, Dubois still stood
in line. Then he stepped up, saluted, and asked
for his furlough. There was none.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a dramatic moment. Sergeant
Bouligny came out from the darkness, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>spirited argument occurred between him and
the officer. The American sergeant then came
over to Dubois and said: “It’s a damned shame.
They held that five years (suspended sentence
for sleeping, when lost by a patrol in ‘No-Man’s-Land’)
over you. Now, man to man, I
want you to promise me you will go right back
to your company. I told them you would. I
stood good for you. The colonel must sign that
furlough. He is not here and we can’t do a
thing to help you.” It was sad. The poor
fellow was crushed. We walked away, leaving
him in the darkness with his bitter thoughts.</p>

<p class='c001'>We arrived at Thill near midnight and were
depositing our equipment at the guardhouse
when a guard came and said to me: “The
sentinel wishes to see you.” I went out and
there was old Tex Bondt! “Yes,” he said, “I
am sentinel tonight. Last night I was in
prison. This is it, the prisoners are out working.
I drew eight days for trying to be reasonable.
Reason is all right in its place, but not
in the army. They nearly worked me to death.
We were carrying timbers to the front line to
make dugouts—three men to a stick. I was in
the middle and I am six foot three!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Next morning Bouligny and I tried to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>some breakfast.  The town was deserted,
badly shot-up. Stores were empty, civilians
gone. Prospects looked bad, when a gunny-sack
was drawn back from a doorway, and a
voice yelled out, in English:  “Here, where
in the devil are you fellows going? Come up
and have a cup of coffee.” It was Tony Pollet,
of Corona, New York.<a id='rD' /><a href='#fD' class='c015'><sup>[D]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fD'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rD'>D</a>. In October, 1917, dressed in the French uniform, I was walking
up the street near the Grand Central Station, New York. A civilian
accosted me in French. We conversed in that language for some
time. He worked the third degree, asked about Battalion D, and
mentioned several names of men I knew. I turned on him and said,
“You must have known Tony Pollet.” The civilian stopped short,
finally found his voice, and gasped out, “Pollet?—that’s me!”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c001'>In the early morning we walked fifteen kilometers
to the railroad and waited for the other
Americans to arrive. Capdeville found some
grease. Sweeney went to a French camp and
talked some potatoes from them. So we ate
“French fried,” with wine, till the train started
for Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Van Vorst was ranking officer, but
Morlae and Sweeney sparred for ground. Said
Morlae to Delpeshe: “You do that again and
I will turn you over to the gendarmes.” Delpesche
replied: “Who in hell are you? I am
taking no orders from you. I belong to Sergeant
Sweeney’s section!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Soubiron had the time of his life. He rode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>down on the foot-board of the coach. He was
determined not to miss the green fields, the
lovely flowers and the smiles of the girls, as
they wished the Americans “Bon Voyage.”
Everything was beautiful after the drab and
dirt of the front.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the platform at Paris the two sergeants
were still disputing.  A petite Parisienne
stepped up to Sweeney, saying: “Pardon,
Monsieur, you came from near Rheims; did
you see anyone from the 97th Regiment on the
train?” The 97th had been badly cut up.
Sweeney remembered that. In an instant his
face changed. He smiled back at the girl and
answered: “No, there were no French permissionaires;
only Americans were on the train.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Two days later each man was relating his
experiences:</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The base-ball man from San Francisco</b>:
“Yes, I arrived in Paris without a sou. I saw
you fellows scatter in all directions, and did not
know what to do with myself. Two French
ladies came along and invited me home with
them. They paid all my expenses and gave me
this five franc note and a sack of food to eat on
my way back.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Percy</b>: “That New York Sun man, Grundy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>found five of us at the Cafe de la Paix. He
ordered dinner. It cost him 120 francs. That
was the best dinner I ever ate, but, Lord, I wish
I had the money it cost!”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Nelson</b>: “Yes, my patron almost threw a
fit when I blew in, but the best of the house
was at my service, good bath, clean underclothes—don’t
know where they came from,
or whom they belonged to. But they insisted
on my keeping them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Morlae</b>: “Yes, I was up at the Embassy,
saw Frazier and he told me....”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bob Scanlon</b>: “My friends were out of town
but left word that I should have the best there
was. So I went up to Place Pigalle and
inquired for a girl I knew, Susie, and they
fished out a man six foot high!”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Dowd</b>: “Yes, that Frenchman was splendid.
When he learned we were Americans he invited
us to the banquet given by the American
Chamber of Commerce at the Palais d’Arsay.
There was just one table of us soldiers of the
Legion and two long tables of men from the
American Ambulance. The Frenchmen were
glad to see us—the Ambulance men did not
seem glad at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘How is that,’ said an American visitor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>speaking to a well-dressed, manicured doctor,
‘are there many Americans in the Legion?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Well, aren’t there a good many of our boys
there?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘There may be, but, of course, WE don’t
know them.’”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Idaho Contractor</b>: “Yes, you fellows can
talk about what you ate. When I got over to
Place Clichy, it was 9 o’clock. Madame was
closing up—all she had left was beans and
vinegar. I had had no vinegar for ten months.
Beans must be bad for the stomach. My appetite
went wrong just the time I needed it most.
I did not enjoy myself at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Van Vorst</b>: “Yes, I went over to Pickpus
and saw the American Ambulance. They
looked very nice and clean but did not recognize
the dirty soldiers from the Legion, but
the French officers did.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bouligny</b>: “I missed everything, did not
know there was anything doing any place.
Thought the 4th was on Sunday; didn’t know
they were holding 4th on the 5th.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Narutz</b>: “Yes, I had a bully time. Met
some old friends at the American Express
Company’s office.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><b>Seeger</b>: “I heard Sweeney was promoted to
a lieutenancy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Capdeville</b>: “What do you think I am carrying
this American flag for? Of course, I am
going to use it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Delpesche</b>: “What are all you fellows carrying
in those packages? You look like a lot
of farmers who just received a consignment
from Sears-Roebuck.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>King</b>: “Yes, we bought this dollar stuff
cheap, just 98 cents and freight.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX <br /> OUTPOST LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In front of Croane, where, in 1814, Frank and
Hun fought for mastery, one hundred years
later, the same nations again battled.</p>

<p class='c001'>The elaborate, naturally drained trench
system of to-day was not. Instead of the
horizon blue, the French soldier wore the old
red pantaloons and dark blue coat. Occasionally
new blue uniforms were sent to the
front, which, wet a couple of times—the new
dyes not holding—quickly become drab. Torn
clothes, ripped, crawling through barbed wire,
are held together by finer wires. New York
Heralds and Daily Mails wrapped around socks
to help keep in the heat, warm not alone the
cockles of the heart, but the soles of the feet.
No smoking cook-kitchen, with steaming kettles
filled with tasty food followed our ranks
on march. Soup dishes and kettles are carried
on knapsack, as in the days of Napoleon. At
the end of a long march, at bivouac time, if the
commissary has not made connection weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>soldiers throw their kettles away. If caught,
eight days in prison, they welcome as relief.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans held Croane—the French and
Germans, alternately, occupied the village of
Croanelle, dominated by the fortress of Croane.
This was before the days of the present heavy
bombardment, and many of the deserted houses
were still intact, beds unmade, dishes yet upon
table, furnished, but vacant. Cattle, tied to
mangers, lay dead in their stabs. In cellars,
where combatants had tunneled through to
connect, the dead of both sides lay impaled
on bayonets. One Frenchman’s teeth were at
a German’s throat, locked in combat, even in
death.</p>

<p class='c001'>Out between the lines lay the unburied dead,
in all shapes and conditions of rot, settled in
the mud, half buried in open shell holes. Dried
fragments of uniforms flapped on barbed wire
through which the wounded had crawled into
sheltered corners and died. No need to tell a
patrol when, in winter darkness, as he stepped
on a slippery substance, what it was—he knew.
In the spring grass grew around and through
these inanimate shapes. Rats and dogs waxed
fat as badgers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<p class='c001'>From the day the 2d Regiment went into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Croanelle till it was relieved, six months later,
no German soldier who set foot in the shallow
trench went back. Our
regiment, repeatedly reinforced,
was kept at full
strength.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Americans there endured
pain and suffering,
the depth of which
Washington’s Army at
Valley Forge never
reached. Those old Continentals
had nothing in
discomfort on these
modern heroes in front
of Croane. Washington’s
Army, in their own
country, had access to
the necessities of life.
They held communion
with their fellows. These
later-day Americans, under
the hardest discipline
in the world, were cut
off from civilization. They were back to the
age of barter and exchange. Money would not
buy goods—there was nothing to be bought—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>if one man had a little tobacco, and another
man a pair of socks, they would swap.</p>

<p class='c001'>No furloughs were granted the first ten
months. Every letter was censored. Packages
of comforts, sent by friends, were stolen or confiscated
en route. They were in a foreign country,
whose language many could not speak.
They had left good, comfortable homes for
these holes in the ground, called trenches by
courtesy, where one waded to his post on guard,
rifle in hand, and carried a wisp of straw or a
piece of plank on which to lie to keep from
sinking into slime and slush, which covered his
clothes with mud and filled his bones with
rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was near midnight, the relief was in the
basement of a shot-up chateau. The guard, on
a scaffold, peering through loopholes made in
a stone wall, was watching Rockwell sentinel
at the advance output and alongside. They
saw him stop, heard a familiar sound (the striking
of a grenade cap), but it was in the rear.
Suddenly Rockwell yelled, “Aux Armes.” Metteger,
the burly Alsatian corporal, ran out, just
in time to catch the explosion of a German
grenade, and was killed. Rockwell, standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>between the grenade and the corporal, was so
thin the charge missed him and lodged in the
fat man. Simultaneously, the guard at the wall
heard a rush, a noise, a rattle of musketry from
behind, and turned about face.  The relief
rushed out of the basement. The Germans,
caught between two fires; cursing, disappeared
into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the guard turned to repel the attackers,
they jumped from the scaffold to the
ground. Capdeville’s hair was singed by a
bullet, a ball went through Soubiron’s cartridge
belt. When Brooks, the cockney Englishman,
jumped, another Englishman, Buchanan, fell
on him, pushed his face into the ground and
filled his mouth with mud. Brooks struck out
and hit Buchanan, who tried to get away to
chase the Boche. “You blankety, blank, blank.”
Biff! biff! biff! “You will, will you?” The two
Englishmen were still fighting when the guard
came back. Buchanan had discovered that
some one had made his gun unworkable, tramping
mud into the magazine. He stopped and
had it out with Brooks.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was at La Fontenelle and Ban de Sapt, La
Viola and Viola Nord, opposite St. Marie aux
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Mines, in reconquered Alsace, among the
Vosges on the Franco-German frontier. Seven
long, weary months we spent among those perpendicular
mountains, with sunburned base
and snowy, dripping tops. Dog trains carried
provisions in winter. Pack mules clamber in
summer, wearing breeching to keep from slipping
down hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>The continuous snows of winter, and the
ceaseless flow of water down the middle of the
trench in summer, while it also dripped from
the roof of the dugout, and seeped up from the
ground below, dampened both clothes and
spirits, as we carried wet blankets and our
misery about, up among the clouds of mist, in
drizzles, sleet, snow and the intense cold. A
sieve was a water-tight compartment compared
to those shut-up dugouts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The constant bombardment often changed so
completely the topography of the mountains,
one could hardly be sure when daylight came
that he was the same man, or in the same place,
as he was the night before.</p>

<p class='c001'>We were beyond civilization. Not a flower, a
garden, a cow, a chicken, a house with a door or
window, or roof, not a civilian or a woman was
to be seen. All work or fight, no recreation, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was a long, continued suffering. We had the
Boche part of the time, bad weather all the
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trenches were so close together we
fought with grenades instead of rifles. The
wire in front, thrown out loose from the trench
behind, was all shot up. The trench itself from
continued bombardment was thirty or forty
feet across the top, with just a narrow path
down the middle, where one walked below the
ground level. The hills were a wilderness of
craters, blown out trenches with unexploded
shells about.</p>

<p class='c001'>Crosses leaning over dead men’s graves,
were littered with ragged, empty sandbags,
while pieces of splintered timber, tangled wire,
mingled with broken boulders and lacerated
tree trunks of all lengths and thickness. Holes
grew now where trees had stood. Roots and
stumps, upturned, replaced splintered branches
and scorched, withered leaves. A few straggling,
upright trunks, eighty to one hundred
feet in the air, were festooned with sections of
blown-up barbed wire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The towns belonged to the dead, wholly deserted
by civilians, with even the old women
gone. Roofless, doorless, windowless ruins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>twisted iron girders and fantastically broken
walls, stood out against the sky, grimly eloquent,
though silent, monuments of kultur.</p>

<p class='c001'>Face to face with death, what is in a man
comes out. I shall never forget one, who, right
name unknown, came from Marseilles. We
used to call him “Coquin de Dieu.” He had
some system whereby he got extra wine—even
at the front. That additional cup or two was
just enough to make him happy and start him
singing. Handsome as a woman, he looked the
careless, reckless ne’er-do-well. During a terrific
bombardment, I was sent to relieve him,
out between two German outposts, one eight,
the other fifteen yards away. Instead of going
to the safety of the sap in the rear, that Frenchman
insisted on staying with me. Germans
broke into the French trench at the adjoining
post, and went to the right. Had they come
left, we would have been the first victims.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was little Maurice, just twenty, who
had been through the whole campaign. When
dodging shells, he could drop quicker than a
flapper and come up laughing every time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maribeau, eighteen, only a boy, always
objected to throwing grenades. “No, I won’t—I
promised my mother and my father I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>not become a grenadier and I won’t.” One
night during a Boche grenade attack, he and
everyone else had to work for self-preservation.
He liked it and became a splendid bomb
thrower.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was with Renaud, an old 170th boy, and
Marti, on post, during a Boche bombardment
and attack. Marti was killed by a grenade.
A crapouillot fell into the trench behind. I
was pretty busy throwing grenades, but caught
a glimpse of a stray sergeant pulling Renaud
under cover. Several days later, noticing a
haversack hanging on the side of the trench,
I wondered why it was there so long, also
whose it might be. Inside was a piece of bread
and a flat tin plate perforated by shell and
splinters. Scribbled on the plate was the name,
“Renaud.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Big, strong, impulsive, was my marching
companion, Peraud. He loved his wife and
hated war. When thinking about war his face
had so deadly an expression, no one dared disturb
him. When his thought was of his wife,
he looked a glorified choir boy. Once in Lorraine,
during repose, he and his companion,
Perora, a theological student, invited me to a
church to hear the curé lecture on Jeanne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>d’Arc. While the student and the curé conversed,
Peraud rang the bell which brought the
soldier congregation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marching behind him, Indian file, through
the trenches one dark night, I missed the barrel
of his rifle against the sky line, and stopped
just in time to prevent falling on top of Peraud,
who had stumbled into a sap filled with the
slush and slime that run from the trench bottoms.
It wasn’t necessary to watch the rifle
after that. I could follow by the smell.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in the trenches I first met him. Boche
bombardment had knocked out the wooden
posts that braced the sides of the trench. Dirt
had fallen in and dammed the running water.
We were detailed to walk, knee deep, into the
horrible slush, and bring those dirty, dripping
posts, on our shoulders, to dry land. Suddenly
he stopped, took a look and asked: “Comrade,
what was your business in civil life?” “I was
engaged in commerce. And you?” “Me? I
am an artist.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Our sergeant spoke a little English. He was
a good sort, who, owning a garage in civil life,
had met many Americans and thought they
were decent enough to invite acquaintance. One
afternoon, during a bombardment, he, Peraud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Perora, Rolfe and Tardy were in a sap. Too
careless to go below, they stood on the top step,
in the doorway, sheltered from behind and on
both sides. There was just the four-foot square
opening in front. A shell dropped into that
opening, killed four, and left Tardy standing
alone. He was a brave soldier before, but no
good after that.</p>

<p class='c001'>Peraud and Perora had been bosom friends.
They came from the same neighborhood, were
wounded and sent to the same hospital, both
changed into the 163d Regiment. Together
they were killed by the same shell.</p>

<p class='c001'>Comrade Deporte was an old 170th man.
Names, being indexed alphabetically, always,
at the end of a long march, Bowe and Deporte
were put on guard, with no chance to cool off
after packing the heavy sacks up the mountain
side. Our cotton shirts, soaked with perspiration,
felt like a board as the body rapidly
cooled during the silent, motionless guard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Deporte was a revelation in human nature.
Unselfish, he did the most arduous and often
unnecessary work without a murmur. We
were always together on guard and frequently
drew the bad places. Once, during a five-hour
bombardment, isolated, impossible to get relief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>to us, he did not complain. Another time, hearing
a suspicious noise in front, I threw a grenade.
We got such an avalanche in return it
almost took our breath away—and Deporte
laughed! Home on furlough, he overstayed
his leave five days and drew sixty days prison.
He smiled—it was sixty days on paper!</p>

<p class='c001'>One fine day we two were taken out in front
during a bombardment. Captain Anglelli, with
two holes in his helmet where a sniper’s bullet
went in and out at Verdun, explained the situation
to Deporte:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have the grenades?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see this hill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is higher than that trench.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can throw into there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Boche will come through there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can hit him, he cannot reach you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The American will stay with you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bomb hell out of them!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hold them there and we will bag them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oui, mon capitaine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Smiling, the captain patted Deporte on the
shoulder. Deporte, looking squarely into his
eyes, grinned back. They understood each
other, those two. It was not superior ordering
inferior. It was man to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>I should like to tell all that happened that
afternoon. It was the wind-up of a week’s
bombardment, and we had a ripping time dodging
about to avoid being maimed for life. We
held a mountain top on the frontier. The Germans
had the peaks opposite, where they had
planted their heavy artillery. When the French
drove back the invading Germans, the lines
stopped within bombing distance—about thirty
yards. We had the upper line, they the lower.
We could throw grenades on them, but it was
hard for them to reach us. So they planted
their line with trench-mortars that throw
aerial torpedoes, crapouillots and bombs the
size of a stovepipe, also others which resemble
a two-gallon demijohn. They came slow. We
could see them—the wide-nosed torpedoes
coming direct, the stovepipes hurtling end
over end.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>These visible shells are only good for short
range. We dodged them, but they kept us
constantly on the move. The captain’s trench
was flattened out—no need to watch that any
more. The bombardment increased. Long
range artillery from the mountains joined the
short range mortars. The black smoke and
noise from the Jack Johnsons and the yellow
smoke from bursting shrapnel did not attract
our attention from those three-finned torpedoes
and hurtling crapouillots.</p>

<p class='c001'>We would dodge for one but a half dozen
might drop before we could look around.
Deporte was buried by one explosion. I had
to pull him out of the dirt. A big rock came
flying down the trench, then a piece of timber
four feet long. Two pieces of metal fell on my
helmet which I picked up and have yet. They
were burning hot, not iron or steel, but copper
and nickel.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a shout in front, we grabbed grenades and
saw to the left a crowd of men running toward
our lines, French and German.  Later we
learned how eighteen Frenchmen went over to
the German blockhouse across the way, gave
the forty occupants a chance to surrender, of
which eleven took advantage. Revolvers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>bombs finished the others. Two Frenchmen,
both my friends, were wounded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans did not seem to like it. They
got more angry and threw all kinds of metal
at our dodging heads. An orderly rushed
around the corner and yelled: “Fall back,
orders from the capitaine.” He scurried away.
We found a sap. I was thirty feet down when
I looked up and saw Deporte standing at the
opening unbuttoning his vest. Steam and
perspiration formed a circle around him, such
as is seen about an aeroplane flying high
against the sun. About thirty feet down into
that sap the steps turned a right angle, then
again changed direction. We sat beyond the
second turning, lighting a candle as fast as the
inrush of air, made by the bursting shells, blew
it out. A couple of hours later, when we looked
for the hill we had held, it was gone. Immense
craters yawned where had been our regular
trenches. The rows of trenches were as waves
of an angry sea, while the ground between was
pitted and scarred beyond recognition.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X <br /> CHAMPAGNE ATTACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The night before the attack of September 25,
1915, Bouligny and I went over to Battalion C.
He picked up a piece of cheese that Morlae had.
Munching away, he demanded, “Where did you
get this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Suippe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought we were forbidden to go out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How did you get by?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I told the sentry I did not speak French,
showed him my old Fourth of July pass, and
walked through.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bouligny said: “Well, we will eat this
cheese so they’ll have no evidence against you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Morlae replied: “We shall need somebody
to help carry the load we have stacked up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have we got?” inquired Casey.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Two canteens of wine instead of one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good,” said Casey.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And 250 rounds of cartridges instead of
120,” called Nelson.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“And a steel helmet, instead of a cloth cap,”
from Dowd.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And four days’ reserve of food instead of
two,” added King.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a new knife for the nettoyers” (moppers-up),
put in Scanlon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a square white patch of cloth sewed on
our backs, so our own artillerymen can recognize
and not blow us up,” finished John Laurent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d rather be here, leaning against this tree,”
said Chatcoff, “than in little old New York,
backed against a telephone pole, trying to push
it into the North River.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” agreed Seeger, “this is the life. The
only life worth living is when you are face to
face with death—midway between this world
and the next.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For one week the Legion had marched each
night fifteen kilometers to the front, dug
trenches and returned to camp in the early
morning. Again that night we went out, and
daylight, September 25, found us established
in a badly demolished trench from
which we emerged at the time set for the
attack, 9:15.</p>

<p class='c001'>The four hours between daylight and the
attack were passed under a furious bombardment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Many were killed or wounded while we
waited to go over the top.</p>

<p class='c001'>The French had, unknown to the Germans,
brought up their 75 cannon and dug them down
in another trench 25 yards behind us. The din
was terrific. Smoke screens and gas shells
nearly blinded us. Men were uneasy and
dodged. The captain caught a fellow flopping.
“Here, you young whelp, don’t you know that
noise comes from our own guns behind?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pera, a Tunis Jew, tore open his first aid
bandage and we filled our ears with cotton to
deaden the noise.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attack was carried out by seven long
lines of soldiers advancing two yards apart,
each line about 100 yards behind the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Colonials and Moroccans had the first
line, the Legion the second. Owing to the
Germans’ concentrated fire on our trenches and
on the outlets, each man did not get out two
yards from the next. Frequently the other
man was dead or wounded. But the objective
was the Ferme Navarin, and at 10:30 it was in
our possession.</p>

<p class='c001'>A soldier’s life, while of some concern to himself,
to an officer is but a means to an end. It
is offered, or given, to get results. The best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>officer obtains the most results with the least
loss. Some give wrong orders and sacrifice
their men. Others seem to grasp every opening
for advancement and gain the objective
with very little loss.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first run to the outlet the slaughter
was terrible. Stretcher bearers carried a continuous
stream of wounded with bloody bandages
on, silent, motionless, pale-faced, dirtily-clothed
men, whose muddy shoes extended
over the edge of the stretchers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nearer the front line, the worse the carnage.
Dead were lying so thick soldiers walked on
upturned faces grazed by hob-nailed shoes.
Side trenches were filled with wounded, waiting
transportation. Some, injured in the hand,
held it up watching the blood flow; others, hurt
in the leg, were dragging that member along.
Holding onto their stomachs were those whose
blood was running down over their shoes. At
one corner leaning against two corpses lay a
young soldier, smooth shaven, curly-hair, mustache
trimmed, his face settling into the
soft, creamy whiteness of death, a smile on
his lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>My mind flashed over to Madam Tussaud’s
wax figure exhibition in London.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Two Moroccans stopped. One pulled off his
vest and found a blackish red bruise on his
chest. His comrade said: “It is nothing, come
along.” The other fell over, dead. A Zouave,
with back broken, or something, unable to get
up, eyes rolling into his head, twisted his body
in agony. The doctor, walking away, said:
“No chance. Leave him; blood poison.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germans had a sure range on the outlet.
Wounded men, walking back in the trench,
were jostled and knocked about by strong, running
men, forcing themselves to the front.
Shells were falling all around as we ran into
“No-Man’s-Land.” Machine guns were out on
the slope, “rat-tat-tat-tat,” a continuous noise.
Men lying behind guns, rifle shooting, working,
cursing, digging trenches, throwing dirt, making
holes.</p>

<p class='c001'>At every corner stood calm, square-faced,
observing officers directing, demanding, compelling.
What are such men in civil life. Why
do we never see them?</p>

<p class='c001'>In the open I stopped and took a quick look
around. The only man I knew was Crotti, an
Italian. He spoke in English: “Where is the
Legion?” The officer overheard. His face
changed. He did not like that alien tongue just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>then, but understood, and smiling, said:  “The
Legion is there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They were crawling up a shallow trench,
newly made in open ground, at an angle of 45
degrees from us. We did not try to force our
way back into the trench against that crowd,
so kept out on top and joined our comrades,
who laughed when they saw us running in from
where the Boche was supposed to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man alongside puts on his bayonet as
the order is passed down the line to go over on
command. The officers snap out: “Five minutes,
three minutes, one minute, En Avant!”
The Colonials, the Moroccans and the Legionnaires,
all mixed up, arrive about the same time.
Up, and over the Boche line trench. Where is
the wire? It has been blown away by artillery.
Instead of deep, open trenches, we find
them covered over! Swarming we go up on
top the covered trenches then turn and throw
bombs in at the port-holes from which the Germans
are shooting. Boches run out at the
entrances, climb from the dugouts, hands in air,
crying, “Kamarad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>More grenades inside and more German
prisoners. The first line men keep going. German
dead lie all about. German equipment is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>piled around; we pass the wounded, meet the
living enemy. A running Zouave met a Boche,
who goes down with the Zouave’s bayonet in
his chest. The Zouave puts his foot on the
man, pulls out the bayonet, and keeps on his
headlong rush.</p>

<p class='c001'>An old, grey-haired Poilu met a Boche in
square combat, bayonet to bayonet. The old
man (his bayonet had broken) got inside the
other’s guard, forced him to the ground, and
was choking him to death when another
Frenchman, helping his comrade, pushed the
old man aside in order to get a sure welt at the
Boche. The old man, quick as a cat, jumped up.
He thought another German was after him and
recognized his comrade. The German sat up
and stuck up his hands. The Frenchmen
looked foolish—it would be murder! Half a
dozen Germans just then came from a dugout.
That old man took his ride with the twisted,
broken bayonet, picked up a couple of German
casques, and, lining the prisoners up, took them
to the rear. Prisoners all about. One big German
officer surrendered with a machine gun
crew who carried their own gun. Unwounded
prisoners lugged their wounded comrades on
their backs while others limped along, leaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>on comrades. Many had broken, bruised heads.
Prisoners bore French wounded on stretchers.
The dead lay in all directions, riddled, peppered
by the 75’s, mangled with high explosives, faces
dried-blood, blackened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Behind the first line, into the newly-made
communication trenches, noticed where dirt
had been thrown to the bottom of the trench,
walking on dead Germans’ grazed faces bristling
whiskers, partially covered with loose dirt,
so that their bodies <a id='corr153.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='was'>were</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_153.11'><ins class='correction' title='was'>were</ins></a></span> not noticed by comrades
going to the front. Continued bombardment,
more dead. Germans running, equipment
strewn everywhere, black bread, cigars,
many casques, more dead, broken caissons,
dead horses, cannon deserted—their crews
killed, Boche shells in lots of three lying about
in wicker baskets. Trenches full of dead, legs,
arms and heads sticking out.</p>

<p class='c001'>We followed the Germans into a maze of gas
and got my eyes and lungs full. Then felt weak
and comfortable. The Luxemburg corporal
came along and pulled me out. Dropping behind,
we finally came upon the Legion, waiting
in a communication trench to flank the Germans.
A wonderful Legionnaire, with the face
of a Greek god (shot in the stomach), came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>hobbling along on a stick. He sat down and
renewed an acquaintance with the corporal
which had been started at Toulouse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over the top again. A backward glimpse
showed the wounded man hobbling behind us,
back again to the front. I noticed the Legionnaires
running, chin forward, bayonet fixed,
greatly bunched, and thought the Germans
could not miss hitting so many men. So,
being the last man in the company, I kept running
along the outside. The corporal was
killed going over. He fell into a shell hole
among a lot of German wounded and dead.
We were ordered to turn to the right, down this
trench. I, the last man, became first.</p>

<p class='c001'>Blinded with gas, I blundered along, bayonet
fixed, finger on trigger, stumbling over dead
and wounded Germans, bumping into sharp
corners of the trench, on into another gas maze,
and across the second line trench. Someone
pulled my coat from behind and I discovered
that our men were going down that cross
trench. So I fell in about the middle of the
company, pumped the gas from my stomach,
and by the time I was in shape again orders
came that we should hold this trench, which
had gradually filled with our men.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>It had rained all day. Racing through the
trenches, dirt fell into the magazines of our
rifles. It makes one furiously angry when the
magazine will not work. I grabbed a rifle laying
alongside a man I thought dead. He was
very much awake. He quite insisted on using
his own gun. The next man was dead. He had
a new rifle. I felt much better.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was impossible to stay in that crowded
trench. I found a large shell hole in the open,
eight feet deep, with water in the bottom. With
shovel and pick, I dug out enough on the side
of the crater to find dry ground and tried to
sleep. I was awakened by officers who wished
to make me go into the trenches. I did not understand
French. Those officers insisted I did.
Of course, I did not. I knew they wanted the
nice, comfortable place I had constructed for
themselves. So, paid no attention, but covered
up my head and tried to sleep. I could not.
Then remembered something—I had eaten no
food for twenty-four hours. So soaked hard
tack in the water at the bottom of the shell
hole, dined, and then went to sleep in spite of
the rain, the bombardment, and the homeless
officers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day made another attack over the top.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Got into a Boche machine gun cross-fire; orders
were to dig down. Noticed a large shell
crater about 20 yards to the left, where a half
dozen Poilu were laying in comfort below the
earth level and fairly safe. Was crawling
toward them on my stomach, with nose in the
ground, when I felt the earth shake (impossible
to hear in the never-ending cannon roar),
looked up, and about 80 or 100 feet in the air,
when they had rested on a teeter after going
up and before coming down,—I saw a number
of blue overcoats, and I looked over to the shell
crater and saw it was larger, fresher and empty.
However, I crawled over there and stayed till
darkness relieved me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those men were in comparative safety, while
I was out in the open and exposed, yet they
were killed, and I lived to tell about it. Soldiers
naturally become fatalists, and will not be
called till the shell comes along with his number
on. They see a shell fall, a cloud of dirt and
dust goes up—no damage done. Another shell
falls,—a man stood there,—he goes up,—he was
in the wrong place, at the wrong time,—and out
of luck. Why worry? There are too many
shells, and the one that gets you is the one you
will never see. If it does not get you right then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>it is time enough to worry,—if it does you won’t
need to worry.</p>

<p class='c001'>On September 28, the Legion attacked the
Bois Sabot or wooden shoe, a wooded eminence
protected by fifty yards of barbed wire entanglements,
stretched, tree to tree, behind which
bristled three rows of machine guns. About
four o’clock, the Legion lined out to attack in
a long row, a yard apart. The Germans watched
our formation, their guns trained on the first
wire, and waited.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, the Colonel said to a Sergeant,
“Here, you take this section. Go over and
wake them up.” No one was anxious. The
rifles of the Boche could be seen above their
trenches. But Musgrave said, “Let’s go over
and stir them up and see what kind of a show
they put up.” The section went, 35 or 40 men.
Just two, both Americans, Musgrave and Pavelka,
came back.</p>

<p class='c001'>That attack lasted all night. Daybreak was
coming. All the officers had been killed, except
a little squeaky voiced Lieutenant. He was
afraid to give the order to retreat. But, daylight
in sight, he finally said, “Gather up the
wounded and go back to the trench we left.”
The dead were left in rows by hundreds, as thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>as autumn leaves, each man on his stomach, face
to the foe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Artillery was then brought up. Two days
later, we again attacked. The wire and the
whole mountain top had been blown away. The
Germans we met were either dead, wounded
or dazed.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI <br /> LIFE IN DEATH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“If a man die, shall he live?” Aye—and that
more abundantly!</p>

<p class='c001'>We know that “except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but,
if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.” Nature
is constantly demonstrating Life as the manifestation
of Death. Nature’s laws are the laws
of God, to whom are all people subject. So,
man, is passing his progress, into a higher, or
lower, form of spirit continuance—as he may
have chosen and prepared.</p>

<p class='c001'>They do not die,—who instil love of country,
and the highest degrees of patriotism, in those
who live.</p>

<p class='c001'>The materialistic profiteer, who shirks his
duty, and fattens on the soldier’s blood,—will
die and pass away as a clod. But the soldier
whose inspiring deeds will warm the blood of
future generations has started a flame that will
burn forever.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII <br /> THE 170TH FRENCH REGIMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When we Americans went into the 170th,
Seeger, Morlae, Narutz and others stayed with
the 2nd Legion, which two weeks later was
merged with the 1st Legion. Narutz remarked,
in his philosophic manner, “The 170th is a regiment
volante, always used in quick, double action
work. Their specialty is bayonet attack.
I am too old to go steeple chasing over barbed
wire, in a ripped up country, with not one hundred
yards of solid ground, then twenty yards
of nothing, a 70 pound sack on my back, a two
dollar thirst in my stomach and Boche machine
guns in front. Believe me, the Legion is quite
swift enough. I know what this is and will
stick to what I have and am used to—what I
have not had, I might not like.” Seeger, as
usual, silent, mystic, indomitable, appeared not
to listen. His thoughts were in the clouds.
He had made up his mind to stay. That settled
it—no explanation necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the Americans who changed, but three,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Sergeant Capdeville, Sergeant Jacobs and Lieutenant
Mulhauser remain. The Colonel, of that
date, is now General Polalacelli.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 170th is a notable regiments. Time and
again have its members been complimented by
General Joffre. They are his children, his pride.
Never were they called upon when they failed
to make good. They have rushed into almost
certain extermination and came out alive.
Anointed with success, they fear nothing. They
have charged into a cataclysm of destruction,
which swallowed up whole companies, and returned
with a battalion of German prisoners.</p>

<p class='c001'>Against all opposition, they prevail. Spite of
death, they live, always triumphant, never defeated.
Theirs is an invincibility—a contempt
of peril, which only men who have continually
risked and won can have. In the confusion and
complications of battle, they are masters in obstruction
and counter-attack. They have been
torn, shocked and churned about—but they
have arrived. Faces burning in zeal, exalted
for the cause they serve, stimulated by the companionship
of kindred spirits, they heedlessly
dash to victory, or, the sunset—for the secret
of victory rests in the hearts of the combatants.</p>

<p class='c001'>We turned directly about and went with this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>new regiment, back to the front line. We relieved
our own old regiment, the Foreign Legion.
Eight men, all Americans, were together
in one squad. Inside of a week, only three were
left. That is, there were but three, when I was
sent away for repairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>We were in a captured German headquarters
with equipment, ammunition, war debris, dead
men and killed horses, strewed about. Along
the edge of a hill was a German graveyard.
About two hundred German soldiers, killed in a
previous engagement, were buried there. German
batteries, on the opposite hill top, kept
bombarding their lost position, hoping to drive
the French captors out. They shot up those
dead Germans—the atmosphere grew pungent—the
stench penetrated every corner. It settled
heavy on the lungs. It was impossible to
get away from it. It was in late October, 1915.
The only time food or water could be sent up
was during the night. Coffee was chilled by
morning. During the day, as usual, we slept
in the bottom of the trenches with shoes and
cartridge belts on. At night the regular program
was,—patrol, guard, digging trenches,
placing barbed wire, bringing up ammunition
and supplies, with always that dreadful smell.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>One morning, October 19, 1915, looking over
at the Boche, I saw a shrapnel burst overhead.
A second after a bullet embedded itself in my
forehead. Some time later, feeling foolish for
having been caught as shortstop for a German
hit, I heard Bob Scanlon say, “You lucky fool.
You lay rolled up warm in those Boche blankets
all morning, while I was up, trying to find a
place to heat the coffee. Now, you will go
south, where it is warm, and I shall have to stay
here and freeze.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> 163RD AND 92ND REGIMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Returning to the front I was sent as a reinforcement
to the 163rd who had just come from
Verdun, where they had one battalion captured
by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a few days rest while they were getting
reinforcements and new clothing and equipment
we were sent up to the front where with
the exception of ten days when we went to Laveline
to be refitted again (but two men left in
my squad). My company, the 7th, were in the
first and second line trenches for seven continuous
months.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the 163rd I saw a French regiment at its
best. The Legion is composed of men from all
countries. The 170th are from many French
regiments and sections. The 163rd all came
from southern France. They saw alike, understood
one another and worked together. Kind
and considerate, they were a band of ideal
brothers. They took pleasure in having an
American feel at home. They made sure that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>he got his share of clothing, rations and duty.
He, noticing those little courtesies, in his appreciation,
became a better soldier.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I liked about this regiment was the
supreme contempt the officers had for the
Boches—and could not but admire how easy
they slipped things over on Fritz.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the even character of the men, it
was not necessary to have as strict discipline
as in the Legion. Here the soldiers were more
content—more companionable—were all veterans—many
wounded bad enough so they could
not have remained in a regiment of attack,—yet
steady and dependable, and almost invaluable,
where the enemy’s trenches were about
thirty yards away,—and the two forces were in
constant touch with each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the winter of 1916-17 weakened by rheumatism,
after fighting in three active first line
regiments, I was finally sent to the 92nd Territorials,
a working regiment, then in a near-by
sector.</p>

<p class='c001'>These grand-dads, from forty to fifty-five
years of age, the debris of “Papa” Joffre’s old
army, were all physically unfit—yet, not old
enough to die. The object in holding them
together was to have a reserve—in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>use what few ounces of strength they still
had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Officers and doctors were considerate and
very kind. But, even that could not keep a
number of the men from caving in as Nature’s
limit was reached.</p>

<p class='c001'>One night at Bussang, after unloading coal in
a snowstorm, my wet cotton gloves were as
stiff with frost as were my knees with rheumatism.
Quite fed up, I went to the doctor, determined
to thrash the matter out with him.
“Yes,” he responded, “I know you are not in
condition, but, we are hard pressed now. We
must use every ounce of energy we have.” I
quit knocking, stuck it out a few days longer,
then went to pieces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is soldier life. He starts out strong and
full of pep, fit to serve in the Foreign Legion,
the best in France. Then in the 170th, graded
the fourth. Then to the 163rd, a good trench
regiment. Then to the 92nd Territorials, a
working regiment. Then to hospital—transferred
back to the Legion—to be invalided
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> HOSPITAL LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In 1915 there were 6,400 hospitals in France
and 18,000 doctors. During large offensives the
wounded arrived in Paris at the rate of thirty
trainloads per day. In Lyons at one time there
were 15,000 wounded men. At Verdun 28,000
wounded men were treated in one hospital during
a 25 day period. In the spring of 1918, 40
per cent of the entire French Army had been
killed, captured or hopelessly mutilated. Of
the 60 per cent remaining at that time there
were 1,500,000 wounded and crippled men in
the hospitals of France. With the exception,
as far as known, of the American Hospital at
Nice and the Scottish Woman’s Hospital at
Royemont, both of which maintain themselves,
the pay for care and attendance of each patient
which comes from the French Government is
limited to one franc, 25 centimes per day (22½
cents). The balance is made up by the Red
Cross, individuals and communities, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>to the largeness, or smallness, of the views and
pocketbooks of those who assist.</p>

<div class='ic005'>
<p>SERBIAN MEDAL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Hospitals are of two
classes. They are in or
out of the army zone.
The Army Zone is a piece
of land under strict military
law, extending, possibly,
twenty miles back
from the trenches.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ordinarily, weekly Red
Cross trains carry the
evacuated wounded, or
disabled, soldiers from the
Army Zone to the interior.
During a general engagement
trains wait, are filled
with wounded from ambulances,
and sent away
immediately as soon as
filled.</p>

<p class='c001'>A limited number of
these decorations were
presented by S. A. R., the
Prince Regent of Serbia, to
President Poincaré of the
French Republic, for distribution
to officers and men
for distinguished and brilliant
conduct under fire.
Two were allotted the
163rd Regiment of the Line—one
for an officer, the
other to a private.]</p>

<p class='c001'>The hospital in the
Army Zone, necessary for
military reasons, is not
looked upon with favor by
the common soldier. It is
too military. He has his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>fill of red tape and regulations. He wants to
forget there ever was a war, or that he ever was
a soldier. He regards discipline as he does lice,
and medicine and bad neighbors. It may be
necessary to put up with them but he does not
wish to do so any longer than necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he must have a nurse, he does not want a
limping, growling, medically unfit man. He
prefers placing his suffering-racked body, injured
by the hand of hate, where it can be
nursed back to health with kindly ministering
love.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sick soldier does not want to be pestered
or bothered. He prefers to be left alone. He
does not wish a nosing uplifter to come and tell
him what he shall do, and what he shall not do.
He had enough orders in the army. Because
he wears a uniform, he is none the less a man.
He may not be rich. But riches are no passport
to heaven. He has only contempt for lively
humbugs, who ape superiority, and try to push
something down his throat which he does not
want.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i_b_173.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Army Zone hospital, supposed to be
sick, he is not allowed outside except under certain
conditions, and then in charge of a nurse.
When convalescent, he is quarantined in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Eclopes. Here, rather than moon his time away,
and to keep from going stark crazy, he asks to
be sent back to the front.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the hospitals of the interior, he gets much
more liberal treatment. If able, he may wander
about, without a chaperon, in the afternoons.
He will buy a red herring and walk up the middle
of the street eating it. Four men go into a
shop, buy five cents worth of cheese, and each
pays for his own wine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Store windows have an irresistible attraction
for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Post cards hold his gaze for hours.</p>

<p class='c001'>A whistling small boy brings him to a full
stop. He has not heard such a happy sound
for a long time. He blesses the little fellow for
showing so much cheer in the midst of suffering.</p>

<p class='c001'>After several days, he notices people stare at
him a good deal. Yes, he limps too much.
Every step brings pain. He senses their kindly
sympathy but, somehow or other, resents it. So,
he goes out into the country, where, while he
rests in the lap of Nature, the warm sun helps
the doctors coax the poison from the wound,
rheumatism from the joints, and shock from
the system.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Away from the front, away from the busy
haunts of men, all through France, in chateaux,
in old convents and high schools, in sisters’ hospitals,
conducted by the Union of Femmes de
France, the Society of Dames Francaises, and
the Society Secours aux Malades and Blesses
Militaires, under the kindly treatment of those
unswerving, unflinching nurses, he recovers his
strength, then goes to the front for Freedom or
Glory Immortal.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall not forget the many little courtesies
received in the French hospitals at Saumur,
Montreuil-Ballay, Remiremont, Pont de Veyle
and Bourg. Suffering unites the sympathetic.
Pain is the barometer that tests the human
fiber. The soldier, who has been through the
fire with his fellows, who has been wounded, as
they were, who suffered, as they did, has an established
comradeship that endures. He was
interested in them and they in him. When he
is low and the day ahead looks dark and dreary,
he can feel their sympathy. Probably no word
is spoken, but he knows the whole ward is pulling
for him. He does not want to disappoint
his friends. He rises to the occasion. That
sympathy means the difference between life
and death.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>In the early days of the war, flowers, cigarettes,
reading matter and luxuries, were showered
upon wounded soldiers. Gradually, as
private and public interests demanded attention,
visitors were compelled to work for themselves,
or for the State.</p>

<p class='c001'>The faithful, never-tiring nurses patiently
remain at their posts, color washed from their
cheeks, hands worn, seamed by labor, dark eyes,
flashing like stars of a wintry night, unceasingly,
they work to bring back to health those
who almost died for them. In their sweet, white
uniforms, suppressing their own troubles with
a jolly smile, they greet and welcome the mud-stained,
lousy, dirty poilu and give him an affectionate
word—far more efficient, a much better
tonic, than medicine.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV <br /> AN INCIDENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Early spring, 1916, at Boulogne, dressed, as a
French poilu, I stepped off the channel boat
from Folkstone, and, hurrying to the railroad
station, learned that the express would not
leave for Paris till 8 o’clock—a wait of five
hours.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day was cold. Snow was blowing around
the street corner. The raw sea breeze cut to the
marrow. Buttoning a thin overcoat, still crumpled
from going through the crumming machine,
sure sign of hospital treatment, I walked
about aimlessly. “Fish and chips.” Yes, that
was what I wanted. I wasn’t hungry, but it
must be warm inside. It was also the last chance
for some time to indulge in finny luxuries. Lots
of water in those long, narrow trenches, skirting
“No-Man’s-Land,” but no fish. Grinning,
I recalled one cold, heart-breaking morning,
when an unseen German yelled across:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hello, Français, have you the brandy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, have you?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“No, we have not; but we have the water!”</p>

<p class='c001'>We knew that—for we had just drained our
trench into theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>I took my time and when not picking fish
bones gazed, reflectively, at the miserable
weather outside. I chatted in English with British
Tommies and exchanged a few remarks in
French with the little waitress. At the cashier’s
counter, a stranger, dressed as an English
private soldier, rasped out, in an aggressive, authoritative
voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here! You speak very good English.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of not liking his tone, I responded,
“Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You don’t know? Well, I know. You speak
as good English as I do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know that you have any monopoly
on the English language.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You don’t know, eh, you don’t know? I
would like to know what you do know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>”Well, I know something you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know enough to mind my own business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a few seconds dead silence, the Englishman
said, “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s my business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s my business to find out.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Well, find out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me see your papers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you don’t let me see your papers, I will
take you up to the Base Court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You won’t take me any place—understand
that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I paid the frightened little waitress. The
English Tommies were taking eyefulls instead
of mouthsfull. I was angered. I was minding
my own business. Why could not the Englishman
mind his. The more I thought of it, the
warmer I got. Turning to him I said, “You not
only don’t mind your own business, but you
don’t know where you are. You are in France,
where soldiers are treated as men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Half an hour later, the Englishman, accompanied
by a Frenchman in uniform, stopped me
in the street. The Frenchman spoke,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good day, mister.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good day!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you show me your papers, if you
please?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who are you—are you a policeman?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What right have you to see my papers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I belong to the Bureau.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“The Bureau of shirkers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, the Bureau of the Place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I will show them at the proper time
and place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A small crowd had collected. A poilu, covered
with trench mud, asked, “What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, this fellow wants to see my papers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, haven’t you got them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me see them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr180.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“At'>At</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_180.11'><ins class='correction' title='“At'>At</ins></a></span> the first glance he saw the Foreign Legion
stamp.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ha, ha, la Legion! I know the Legion, come
along and we will have a litre of wine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So, we two walked away and left the crowd
disputing among themselves. I remarked to
the Englishman, who had stood silently watching,
“I told you before, you were too ignorant
to mind your own business. Now, you see you
are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The wine disposed of, we parted. Looking
back, I saw the Englishman following a hundred
yards behind. He crossed the street and
stood on the opposite corner. He stopped three
English officers and told his little tale of woe.
They crossed, in perfect time, spurs jingling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and bore down, three abreast, upon me, the
pauvre poilu, who did not salute.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have come from England, where you
have been spending your convalescence?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you your convalescence papers with
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must excuse me; but, would you mind
showing them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After scanning them, one said to the other,
“They look all right.” No answer. “They look
all right, don’t they, Phil?” No answer. The
junior officer, a Lieutenant, conducted the
examination. Of the other two older men,
one turned his head away, looking down the
street, the other gazed at the Lieutenant
with a peculiar, almost disgusted expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>I then asked, “By the way, is it the business
of the English in France to demand the credentials
of French soldiers? What right has that
man to interfere with me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must show your papers to the military
authorities.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that man a ‘military authority’?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>The Lieutenant looked round and not seeing
the disturber, turned to Phil, “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I don’t know. He said something about
going to get the military police. Let’s go.” The
Lieutenant, turning to me, said, “It is all right.
You may go and tell that man we said you were
all right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I did not move, but stood at attention and
saluted while the officers walked away.</p>

<p class='c001'>I didn’t know who “that man” was, nor yet
the name of “we,” but I didn’t care. Half an
hour later “that man” arrived with English
soldiers, or military police, headed by a newly
made Corporal and a Scotch veteran who radiated
intelligence with dignity and self-respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>After walking, captive, a few minutes, I
asked, “Where are we going?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To the Base Court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I thought I was a sucker, playing the Butt-in-ski’s
game. Throwing my back against the
wall, I answered,—“If you want to take me to
the Base Court, you will have to carry me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A long silence followed, and a crowd collected.
The English corporal started to bluster.
I demanded,—“What business have you
to interfere with me?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“We have orders to make you show your
papers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who gave you those orders?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Corporal did not answer. The Scotchman
turned to him and said,—“Who is that
damned fool that is always getting us into trouble?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Corporal responded,—“I don’t know,—he
gave me a card. Here it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I looked over the Corporal’s shoulder and
read, Lieutenant P——n.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Scotchman asked,—“Don’t you have to
show your papers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, to those who have the right to see
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The gendarmes, the commissaire, and the
proper officials.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, that smooth Scotchman slipped one
over on me,—“Look here, soldier, don’t be foolish.
Think of yourself and look at us—we
would look like hell getting into a row with a
French soldier, with this crowd about, wouldn’t
we? If you don’t want to go to the English
court, let’s go to the French commissaire and
get the damned thing over with.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I replied, “You are engaged in a lovely business,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>aren’t you? You permit German officers,
who are fighting in the German army against
Great Britain, to retain their titles in the English
House of Lords; and you come over to
France and arrest your ally, the French common
soldier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We had to mind orders, ma lad, ’E don’t
doubt ye’re a’ richt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Corporal put in, “I’m not so sure about
that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I replied, “I bet you’re making a trip for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What will you bet?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I don’t know—a glass of beer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good, that’s a go,” said the Corporal. “Ah’ll
help ye drink it,” said the Scot.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Commissaire examined my papers
closely. Turning to the Corporal, he asked,
“What have you brought this man here for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Corporal replied, “He speaks very good
English and not very good French.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Commissaire observed, “I don’t know
about his English, but he speaks better French
than you do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We don’t know who he is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Commissaire responded, “This man is a
soldier of France, an American citizen, a volunteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>in the Foreign Legion. His papers show
that, and his identification badge confirms it.
The papers also state he was wounded in the
forehead. Look at that scar! The papers show
he is returning to his regiment. Here is his railroad
ticket. What do you want with him?
What charge do you enter against him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Corporal looked uncomfortable. The
Scotchman walked away. The Commissaire
came around the table and shook hands with
me. In horror, the Corporal whispered, pointing
to the Commissaire, “He is a Colonel!” and
started to walk away. I called out, “Here,
where are you going—aren’t you going to buy
that beer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>After buying, the Corporal hurried off. I
followed more slowly, watched half a dozen
English soldiers in animated conversation with
the Corporal, the Scotchman and the Lieutenant
Buttinski.</p>

<p class='c001'>I studied the <a id='corr185.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pantomine'>pantomime</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_185.21'><ins class='correction' title='pantomine'>pantomime</ins></a></span> for some time, then
wandered about, till my train was ready to start
for Paris. Seeing Lieutenant P——n looking
through the iron railing, I waved him farewell;
but he did not respond. A Frenchman
would have either waved his hand or shook his
fist!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> NATURE’S FIRST LAW</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The American soldier in France finds new
scenes, new conditions, new customs. Unconsciously
he compares life back home with his
new experiences, often to the latter’s disadvantage.
He sees things he does not like, that he
would change, that he could improve. But,
what does appeal to him as perfect is the large
number of small farms (53 per cent of Frenchmen
are engaged in agriculture) with the little
chateaux, built upon miniature estates, exquisitely
tended, artistically designed, that give
joy to the eye and food for the stomach. These
beautiful homes encourage thrift, they show
him, often, the better way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pride of possession makes the Frenchman
patriotic, national. When the enemy struck
France, they struck him. He rushed to the
frontier to meet invaders who sought to subdue
him and destroy his happy home. From a
cheerful, mirth-loving man, he has become serious
and morose. Not now does he sing or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>laugh any more. He has been treated unjustly.
An overwhelming power tried to force on him
something he will not have. He does not bluster—he
waits. He does not scold—he works.
When the time comes—he acts.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the non-land-owning German industrial
slaves, driven by the strong hand of Autocracy,
he says,—“You shall not enslave us. If you
have not the brains to free yourselves, we shall
free you, whether you wish it or not.” To the
robbers’ cry for peace (so they can legalize
their stolen loot) the French soldier replies,—“Yes,
when justice has been done, justice to the
wronged, the oppressed, the raped. Justice is
obtained by regular procedure in a criminal
court, not by negotiation between equals. Arbitration
is not possible between a crazy man
and the woman he has assaulted. The mad man
must be caught and properly judged. If insane,
he should be confined, if not, he must
be punished.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As civilians become city broke, soldiers become
army broke. Instead of walking in mobs,
they move in rows. Near the front, from marching
in companies, they advance in sections.
These disintegrate, when an apparently stray
shell comes along. Units become individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>of initiative and intelligence, adaptable to sudden,
strange environment. Necessity supersedes
the regular book of rules. Books are
printed, orders given, to regulate ordinary conditions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier’s conditions under fire are neither
ordinary nor regular. Instinct tells him when
to brace, when to duck. He knows an order
to stand up or lie down won’t stop that shell,
put his cocoanut back, or reassemble his family
tree. So, he does what he thinks best. He may
obey or disobey the order, and save or lose his
life. The man who gave the order may die because
he did, or did not, obey.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good soldier can generally kick off unnecessaries
as fast as a poor officer can load them
on. He runs light before the wind. Instead of
wearing himself out as a hewer of wood and a
hauler of water, he saves his strength for the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>A luminous watch on the wrist, a compass in
the pocket, a 2×6 box, with toilet necessaries,
are his private stock in trade. The other sixty
pounds are regular army. He always hangs
onto his gun, cartridges, bombs, little shovel,
and tin hat. He doesn’t want tight-fitting
shoes, but prefers them a size or two large. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>doesn’t buckle his belt regulation style. Instead
of buckling his cartridge belt in front, he
fastens it on the side, so he can slide the cartridge
boxes around, where they won’t gouge
into his body when he sleeps. He covers his
rifle with oil. He wipes out his mess tin with
dry bread crumbs. He does not gormandize before
a long march, or fill up on cold water. He
keeps his feet in good condition. He covers up
his head when asleep, so the rats won’t disturb
him. He keeps his rifle within reach, and is
always ready to move at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, he may have eaten up the regulation
hand-book of rules, for breakfast, dined
comfortably on regimental orders, and, going
to sleep, with taps blowing in his dome, dreamed
sets of fours and double time. Next day, he
wakes up, to find by actual experience that,
while plans are made and ordered, everything
is actually gained by opportunity, individuality,
initiative.</p>

<p class='c001'>He may pass years in peaceful climes, going
like a side-walk comedian, through the empty
mummeries of a Broadway spectacular production.
Put under shot and shell, he just knows
he is a soldier, who must keep his feet warm
and his head cool.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The Poilu is first, first on outpost, first at the
enemy, first in his home, first in the affection
of his country. From the ranks of the poilu the
officers are drawn. He is the Foundation. He
honors France, France honors him.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, in 1914, he, with the original Tommy
Atkins, turned at the Marne, attacked fifty-two
army corps of well-equipped, well-drilled, rapidly
advancing, victorious Huns, outnumbering
him 8 to 5, and drove them back with his bayonet
(for some regiments had no cartridges),
he saved not only France, but England, America
and civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the terrible year of 1915, it was the
bare breast and naked bayonet of the poilu and
the little French 75 that halted superior forces
of the enemy, flanked and aided by longer-ranged,
heavy artillery, Zeppelins, liquid flame
and aeroplanes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Remember, German casualties, the first year
of the war, were 3,500,000 men.</p>

<p class='c001'>For eight continuous months, he was adamant,
behind Verdun. One million men (600,000
Germans and 400,000 French) were incapacitated
within the three square mile tract
that guards the entrance to that historic
town, where, a century before, Napoleon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>kept his English prisoners. Here, the poilu
sent the German lambs to glory as fast as
their Crown Prince could lead them to the
slaughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>With face of leather, his forehead a mass of
wrinkles, which hurt neither the face nor his
feelings—a man as careless of dress as the
French poilu, naturally, doesn’t care whether
his clothes fit him or not,—he goes his fine,
proud way. His once happy countenance, now
saddened by suffering, will yet light up in appreciation.
A little kindness makes him eloquent.
Strong in the righteousness of his
cause, he does not bow his head in sorrow, or
bend in weakness. He stands upright, four-square
to the world. He has lived down discomfort.
He cares nothing for exposure or
starvation. He has seen what the brutes have
done in the reconquered villages he passed
through. He is determined they shall not do it
in his home, or, if his home is in the invaded
territory, he declares they shall pay for the
damage. Animated by the spirit of justice, ennobled
by the example of St. Genevieve, of
Jeanne d’Arc, of Napoleon, inspired by the
courage and devotion of the wonderful women
of France, supported by a united country, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>knows he is fighting for self-preservation and a
world’s freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>He closed, locked, barred the door at the
Marne. Now he guards the gate. He makes
no complaint and asks no favors. With almost
certainty of death in front, trouble in his heart,
body racked by fatigue, with dark forebodings
of the future, bled white by repeated onslaughts,
he remains at his post and does his duty, without
a murmur.</p>

<p class='c001'>French officers are real, improved property,
not vacant lots. They are leaders, not followers.
Ordinary people see what goes on before
their eyes. The French officer is not an ordinary
person. Anything that is happening, or
has happened, his quick mind connects with
something else a mile away—not yet arrived.
When it comes along, it has already been met;
and he is waiting for the next move. His special
study is the German Military Manual, his
specialties concentration and initiative.</p>

<p class='c001'>He will grasp another man’s opportunity, tie
a double knot in it, and have it safely stowed
away, before the bungler misses it. He discounts
the future, beats the other man to it and
arrives with both feet when not expected—just
before the other is quite ready. Endowed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>foresight, farsight, secondsight and hindsight,
he sees all about and far away in front. Every
isolated movement is noticed. He connects it
up with some future possible development,
eventuality or danger.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men of other nations may have delusions
about German organization and system, but
the French officer has none. He has beaten
Fritz, time after time. He knows he can do it
again; and, if there is any one thing he especially
delights in, it is to throw a wrench into
that ponderous, martial machinery and break
Kultur’s plans. Germans are lost with no rule
to follow, and their head-piece won’t work.
They are at the mercy of the man who makes
precedents, but who does not bother to follow
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many a soldier has an aversion to saluting
officers—it looks like servility. We do it with
pleasure in France, as a token of respect. The
French officers at the front do not insist upon
it, and often shake hands after the return salute.
Mon Capitaine is the father of his company, the
soldiers are mes enfants (my children). They
go to the captain when they have a grievance,
not as a favor, but because it is their right; and
he grants their request—or gives them four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>days in prison, as the case demands, with a
smile.  Soldiers accept his decision without
question. The French officer does not mistake
snobbishness for gentility or braggadocio for
bravery. In the attack, he takes the lead. In
the trench warfare he shares dangers and discomforts
with his men.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a great honor to be an active French officer.
He is there because his achievements
forced him upward. He has climbed over obstacles,
and been promoted on account of merit,
not through influence. He holds the front,
while the inefficient, the aged, or crippled, are
relegated to the rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier pays with his hide for the civilian’s
comforts. The civilian, in turn, apes the
soldier, presents a military bearing, in khaki
coat, with swagger stick, a camera, a haversack
and Joiners’ decorations. While the citizen
works (or shirks) to sustain the soldier, he is
either using his strength on the front, or building
it up in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c001'>An enthusiastic, spirited <a id='corr194.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='volunter'>volunteer</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_194.23'><ins class='correction' title='volunter'>volunteer</ins></a></span>, gradually
becomes a silent, sober, calculating veteran. His
days have been troubled. His nights knew no
peace. Recognizing discipline as the first principle
of organization, that it is necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>have individual obedience, for a group to act
harmoniously, he submits. On the front, he
finds—himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Half a dozen men are taking comfort in the
shelter of a dugout. The next instant, five are
one hundred feet in air, snuffed out, torn into
atoms. But one is left, staring, mouth open.
The others, swift arrivals at Kingdom Come,
went so quickly into the great Beyond, they
never knew or felt the shock.</p>

<p class='c001'>So with the rum ration low and the water
high, the morning bright in sunlight, surroundings
dark with death, one’s thoughts spring
from the mind. Words fill the mouth. One
grasps his pencil to catch burning impressions
that flood his brain. He might as well try to
tell his grandmother how to raise babies as to
think straight! He reaches out and connects
up, apparently isolated, strings of thought. He
links a chain of circumstance bearing on destruction’s
delirious delusions that now rocks
the foundations of the world, which reacts on
and affects every civilization, person, and individual
on earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looks at things from an angle different
from that of the civilian. He has a new conception
of life. He is not the same person he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>was before the war. No longer does he smell
the flowers, eat the fruit, or dwell in the home
of civilization. He has lived, like a beast, in a
hole in the ground, and slept in a seeping dugout
with the rats and the lice. He has seen his
companion go over the top, killed off, like
germs, changed from a human comrade into a
clod. He has lived long between two earthen
walls, the blue sky above, a comrade on each
side, with Fritz across the way.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a narrow prospect. His point of view
was limited; but he knew, that while apparently
alone, he and his comrades were links in
that strong, continuous chain of men who keep
back the enemies of Freedom. Behind that
chain are others, bracing, reinforcing,—artillery,
infantry, aviators, reserves, money, provisions
and ammunition, flocking to his aid
from America, from Great Britain, from the uttermost
parts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those larger operations in the rear affect him
but indirectly. The details in front are of vital
interest. They mean life or death. Every alteration
in the landscape demands closest investigation.
Boys do not play, nor old women
gabble, in No-Man’s-Land. Nothing is done
without a reason, and, for every change,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>there is a cause. An unusual piece of cloth
or paper is scrutinized by a hundred men,
while a suspicious movement empties their
guns.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier acquires the habit of noticing little
things. He sees a small, starved flower,
struggling for sunshine and strength, alongside
the trench. He wonders why it chose such an
inhospitable home. Next day, there is no
flower, no trench—just an immense, gaping
hole in the torn ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>He watches the rats. Why are they so impudent
and important? He grows so accustomed
to them, he does not even squirm, when
they run across him in the darkness at night.
He knows they have enough camp offal and
dead men’s bodies—they do not eat the living.
He watches the cat with interest. She is an
old timer and has seen regiments come and go.
Her owners are in exile—they have no home—the
Germans took it. So, pussy, a lady of sense
and good taste, dwells with the French soldiers.
He looks at her long, lanky frame and wishes
for some milk to give her, to counteract the poison
of the rat food. A shell comes along. Pussy
runs into the dugout, but comes out again to
be petted. Another shell, again she scurries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>away. Kitty does not like shells any more than
do humans.</p>

<p class='c001'>War is the great leveler. Deplored as pitiless
destroyer, it more than equalizes, a creator
of good. It annihilates property, kings and
thrones; but it produces men. It taps hitherto
unseen springs of sympathy and mutual helpfulness,
where thrived formerly but the barren
waste of self-sufficiency. It unmasks the humbug
and reveals the humanitarian. It teaches
individual self-lessness. The cruelties of the
oppressor are overcome by love for the oppressed.
The dominance of wickedness is
brought low by sweet charity for its victims.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> THE INVADED COUNTRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have seen the German under many conditions.
In the early days of the war, I used to
listen to his songs—sung very well. But, he
does not sing now. I have watched the smoke
rise, in the early morning, as he cooked his
breakfast. I have dodged his flares, his grenades,
and his sentinels, at night. I have heard
his shovels ring as he dug himself down, and
have listened to his talk to his neighbor. I have
seen him come up on all fours, from his dugout,
crying “Kamarad”; and I cannot say, that, as
a common soldier, he is a bad fellow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The brutality seems to start with the sous-officer.
It gets more refined and cruel as rank
goes up. I have noticed the dazed, hopeless expression
of pregnant women at Sillery-Sur-Marne.
They stayed under fire of the guns,
rather than carry their grief into safety. They
emerged from their Calvary, with faces as of
the dead, impassive, masklike, hiding scars of
agony.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>I talked with a young woman shop-keeper at
Verpeliers. The Germans had been in her house—slept
on the floor, thick as sardines in a box.
They ate up her stock and did not pay. Was
she not afraid? She laughed a happy laugh.
“What me, Monsieur, afraid? I am Francaise.
What do I care for those swine? The sous-officers
tried to make me give in. They pointed
guns at me, and tried to pull me along with
them when the French returned. I screamed
and fought. Four of my lodgers are where those
crosses are at the bend of the road. The others
are prisoners. I am paid, all right, and am satisfied.”
“Yes,” she continued, “they charged
our old men with being in telephonic communication
with the French Army. Twelve were arrested,
marked with a blue cross on the right
cheek, and have not been heard from since.
Two, M. Poizeaux, aged 47, and M. Vassel, 78
years old, were brought back and shot the same
evening.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At Rodern, in reconquered Alsace, where the
natives spoke German, the streets were marked
in German letters, German proclamations were
on the walls, and German money was current,
I sat with Tex Bondt, in a low Alsatian room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>by candle light. The heavy family bed was let
into a wall and screened off by a curtain, the
floor was of stone, the furniture primitive. A
short, squat woman was bewailing her misfortunes.
This mother had six sons and three
daughters. Three boys mobilized with the German
Army. Two were killed. The other is on
the Russian front. Of the three, who ran away,
and joined the French army, one was killed and
two wounded. Two of her girls, nurses in the
German Army, were killed during a bombardment.
As she listened, I watched emotion come
and go in the eyes of the remaining daughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the hospital at Montreuil-Ballay, I met an
old man, wounded in the arm. The wound would
not knit. Unable to sleep, weeping relieved
him. He said, “My wife and I were at home
near Lille, in bed one night. The Germans
broke in the door, came upstairs, jabbed me
with a bayonet and made me get out. I kept
going and joined the French Army.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And your wife, what of her?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know, I have neither seen nor heard
from her from that day to this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, in the hospital at Pont de Veyle, a
young man on a neighboring cot told me, “Yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>I am from the invaded country. My name is
La Chaise. Before the war, my father was Inspector
General of railroads for the Department
of the North, with headquarters at Lille.
When the Germans advanced he was taken
prisoner. I ran away, joined the French Army,
and my mother and sister were left at our home.
A German Colonel billeted himself in the house.
He liked my sister,—she was very beautiful.
This is her photograph, and these are tresses
of her hair when she was twelve and eighteen
year of age. This is her last letter to me. One
night the Colonel tried to violate my sister. She
screamed, my mother ran in, shot him twice
with a revolver and killed him. The sentry entered,
took my mother and sister to prison; and,
next morning they were lined up against a wall
and shot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>One night at Madame’s,—the bake-shop
across the road from the hospital at La Croix
aux Mines, with Leary, an Irishman, Simpson,
a New Zealander, and an Englishman who was
in charge of the Lloyds Ambulance service, we
listened to Madame.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, the Germans descended on us from the
hilltops like a swarm of locusts, ate and drank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>up everything in sight, hunted us women
out of our houses into the road and told us it
was our last chance for liberty. We ran and
the Germans followed. We did not know we
were being used as a screen, that we were sheltering
the Boche behind. The French would
not shoot at us but they got the Germans just
the same, from the flank. I shall never forget
our selfishness. All we thought about was getting
to our French friends, and we were covering
the advance of our enemies! If we had
known, we’d have died first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Englishman, who had been in the retreat
from Mons, drawled out,—“Yes, you Americans
think the Germans are not bad people. I
used to think so, too, but when I listened to the
Belgians telling how some little girls were
treated, though I felt they were telling the
truth, it was too horrible to believe. So three
of us Red Cross men went out one night,—where
they told us the girls were buried. We
dug them up; and, let me tell you, no person on
earth will ever make me associate with a German
again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At Nestle, they carried away 164 women.
The official German explanation was that they
should work in Germany, while the cynical officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>said they would use them as orderlies. On
August 29, 1914, when the Germans entered the
city, a mother of seven children was violated by
three soldiers. Later, she was knocked down
and again assaulted, by an officer. Five inhabitants
were lined up against a wall to be shot,
when a French counter-attack liberated them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the spring of 1917, at Vraignes, in the invaded
district, the Germans told the people they
were to be evacuated. After the inhabitants
had gathered their personal belongings, they
were driven into the courtyard, stripped and
robbed of their possessions.  Twenty-four
young women were carried away from this town
of 253 population.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Le Bouage, a suburb of Chauny, before
the Germans retreated, the French refugees
were lined up a distance of two kilometers on
the Chauny-Noyon road and kept there, in a
pouring rain, four hours. Even the invalids
were carried out on stretchers. German officers
passed along the line and picked out thirty-one
young girls and women, one an invalid girl,
thirteen years of age, and carried them away
with the retreating army. Of the remainder
within two weeks after fifty persons succumbed
from the exposure.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>On February 18th, at Noyon, when the Germans
were compelled to retreat, in addition to
burning, wrecking and looting, they carried
away by force fifty young girls between fourteen
and twenty-one years of age. They looted
the American Relief store, dynamited the building,
then turned the canal water into the basement.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Roubaix, Turcoing and Lille 25,000
civilians were deported.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These slave raids commenced, April 22,
1916, at 3 o’clock in the morning. Troops, with
fixed bayonets, barred the streets, machine guns
commanded the roads, against unarmed people.
Soldiers made their way into the houses, officers
pointed out the people who were to go.
Half an hour later, everybody was driven, pell-mell,
into an adjacent factory, from then to the
station, whence they departed.” Taken from
the Yellow Book, published by the Minister of
War, dated June 30, 1916.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Warsage, August 4, 1914, the day Belgium
was violated, three civilians were shot, six
hanged, nine murdered.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Luneville, eighteen civilians were killed,
including one boy of twelve, shot, and an old
woman of ninety-eight, bayoneted.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>At Liege, twenty-nine civilians were murdered,
some shot and others bayoneted—yet
others burned alive.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Seilles, fifty civilians were killed.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Audenne, August 20 and 21, 1914, 250 civilians
were killed, according to French records,
while General Von Bulow, over his own
signature, in a written order to the people of
Liege, dated August 22, says that he commanded
the town to be reduced to ashes and
ordered 110 persons shot.</p>

<p class='c001'>The process of terrorism is invariably the
same:—First, the crushing blow of invasion,
followed by pillage, rape and murder; then,
when the victims are paralyzed, crushed in
spirit, shocked to the heart’s core, obnoxious
regulations are published and enforced to prevent
their recuperating.</p>

<p class='c001'>At La Fontenelle, Ban de Sept, and many
other villages along the front, manure had
been thrown into the wells, the fruit trees were
cut down, the copper was taken from coffins of
the dead, the farm houses were demolished, and
all property was taken away or destroyed. One
would not pay $10 for the whole outfit of a peasant
farmer’s home: table, a half dozen chairs, a
bedstead in the corner, a crucifix hanging on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the wall, a marriage certificate and a picture
of the virgin, yet all was gone. The ammunition
trains that came up from Germany went back
loaded with such poor people’s belongings.
Nothing left, an old woman’s bonnet on a dung-heap,
a baby’s shoe in a corner, a broken picture
frame or two—that’s all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Talk about forgiving the Germans! Robbing
the poor, the destruction of property, possibly
may be forgiven. Property can be replaced.
But, the systematic, deliberate ruin of
non-combatant, innocent women and children,
is a crime against civilization that can never be
forgiven or forgotten. For generations to
come, the German will be treated as an outlaw.
He will be shunned—worse than a beast. Unclean,
he will have to purge himself before he
may be again accepted in the society of decent
women and men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Think of those fine-grained, sensitive French
girls, compelled to live with brutes—generally
surly, often drunk, who have killed their husbands,
their brothers, their fathers! They
have broken all the rules of war. They have
outraged every decency. They are so sunk in
the abyss of shame that they know neither respect
for the living nor reverence for the dead.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> LOVE AND WAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Love and war go together. War destroys
the body but love lives on with the soul. Love
and war have transformed the hitherto seemingly
empty-pated, fashionable woman to an
angel of mercy. Socialists have developed into
patriots, artisans have become statesmen, good-for-nothings
are now heroes, misers have
grown to be philanthropists.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man, missing woman’s ministrations at the
front, turns instinctively to her when opportunity
offers. Hard, fierce, unyielding to his
fellows, he relaxes in her sheltering affection.
He is but a boy grown. He wants to be petted,
coddled, civilized again.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman realizes he has suffered for her.
He knows what she has sacrificed for him.
War has brought them together, brushed aside
false pride and hypocrisy and revealed refreshing
springs of patriotism and love out of which
flows a union of hearts and hopes that only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>those who suffer, sacrifice and endure together
can realize.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man is better for having been a soldier.
He is self-reliant, stronger in mind and body.
Through discipline he has become punctual
and dependable. All snobbishness, fads and
isms are now out of him. He is more tolerant
and charitable. He recognizes the value of
women’s work in the home, in the hospital and
in the munition factory. As a representative
of her country, whose uniform he wears,
he carries himself more proudly, more uprightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>What a soldier is to the army, a home is to
the nation. The home is safe only so long as
is the country. With foreign invasion, all
values become nothing. The woman, the man,
the home, the country are interwoven. Beyond
lie the right to live their lives, personal liberty,
representative government, the preservation,
yes, even the propagation of the race.</p>

<p class='c001'>To check that on-coming German tide which
threatened to wipe away everything he holds
dear, the soldier has fitted himself into that
surging, bending, human wall. Behind it,
under the shadow of death, woman works and
waits, in a quiet that knows not peace—often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in vain—filled with care and dread, ever striving
to be calm, she hides her heart’s pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ancestors died for the liberty his flag represents.
Posterity must enjoy the same freedom.
So, he bridges the gap, shoulders the
load and becomes a better lover, husband,
father. Having learned his obligation to the
nation, he is a better citizen for all time. One
man’s daughter loves and marries another’s
son and they become one. War tears them
apart. He goes to the trenches. She keeps
the home fires burning. Love holds them together
while he fights to protect and preserve,
she works to support and maintain.</p>

<p class='c001'>That man is not yet whose pen can do justice
to the incomparable woman of France.
She is a wonderful combination of heart, head
and health. The women of colder climes love
with their minds. The French woman with her
heart. She gives all, regardless of consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cynical critics may have their cool sensibilities
shocked at the sight of a well-turned
ankle, crossing a muddy street. That is as near
as they get to the sweet creature they outwardly
condemn, but secretly approve. She
plays square and wants to love as well as be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>loved. She gives love and is loved in return.
While the woman who wants something, but
gives nothing, instills her selfishness into
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The selfish person loves him or herself and
gives no love to friend, family or country. The
unselfish woman absorbs love, and, as a flower
its perfume, scatters fragrance. She inspires
the noblest sentiments of loyalty and patriotism.
She places herself and her best beloved
upon the altar of her country. It is always she
who has given most, who is willing to give all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mere man notices her dainty figure, her
happy disposition, her cheery, outspoken
manner, her charm and goodness of heart, the
utter absence of vulgarity and ill-temper. Her
tears are shed in solitude. Laughter is for her
friends. He admires her at a distance, because
she is sheltered in the home until marriage.
The French man must pass the family council
before becoming an accepted suitor. He consults
them in his business ventures.  His
troubles become theirs when <a id='corr211.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Madamoiselle'>Mademoiselle</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_211.23'><ins class='correction' title='Madamoiselle'>Mademoiselle</ins></a></span>
changes to Madame and is his comrade as well
as a continued sweetheart. She devotes her
whole time and attention to him. Her clever,
home-making instinct is combined with good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>business sense. She is a valuable partner in
life’s great enterprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most beautiful sights in France
is, on a Sunday afternoon the poilu home on
furlough, satisfied to drink a bottle or two of
wine with his family, and rest. He did not want
to see anyone else. But she insists he must
see grandmother and sister-in-law, drop into
the cafe and inquire about old comrades, then,
enjoy a walk out into the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the gathering twilight Madame conducts
her straggling brood home, her hands full of
flowers, her eyes full of love—the little doll-like
children, with long, flowing hair, romping
nearby. The poilu has lost that dark, brooding
look. That little touch of Nature and the
woman diverted his mind from suffering and
revived his sentiment. She sent him back to
the front with a smile on her lips—hiding the
dread of her heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>The thought of peace is ever with her—she
longs for it. But her conscience will not permit
her to ask it. She thinks of the thousands of
graves that dot the hillsides with the cross at
the head. She will suffer the torments of hell
rather than that they shall have died in vain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their little savings have been used up. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>clothes are worn thin. She works, slaves to
keep the wolf from the door. She manages to
send an occasional five-franc note to her poilu.
She labors in munition factories, the tramways,
the postal service, in the fields, replacing
the man, while cows and dogs do the work of
the horses, who, like the men, are on the front.
She wears wooden shoes and pulls hand-carts
about the street. She drives the milch cow
that plows the land, cleans the cars and wipes
the engines on the railroad, cooks the food and
nurses the wounded and sick in hospitals,
does clerical work in the commissary department
and military bureaus—chasing out
the fat slackers who were strutting in the
rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of all, she retains her feminacy. She
is still as alluring, as good a comrade, as cheerful
and gay, outwardly, as though her body
was not racked by fatigue, her heart choked
with sadness. Occasionally she forgets herself.
The mask falls off and trouble stares
through the windows of her soul. Catching
that look in the eyes of his nurse, a soldier
exclaimed: “Cheer up! It will be all right
after the war.” She replied: “After the war?
There will be no ‘after the war.’ You’ll be dead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>I’ll be dead. We shall all be dead. There’ll be
no ‘after the war.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Many French girls have deliberately married
mutilated cripples to cheer and to help them
earn their living. A beautiful young woman,
gazing into the eyes of her soldier, said:
“Why should we not? They lost their legs and
arms for us—we cannot do too much for them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Does the poilu appreciate this? Does he?
What if he did lose one leg for such a woman?
He would give the other with pleasure!</p>

<p class='c001'>On furlough one evening, eating supper in
my favorite cafe in Paris, I observed a most
horribly repulsive object. He had once been a
poilu, but a shell battered his face so that it
resembled humanity not at all. His nose was
flattened out. His skin was mottled and discolored.
A hole was where the mouth had
been. Both eyes were gone and one arm was
crippled. He sat and waited for food. Madame
came from behind the counter and looked on.
A fat boy, repulsed and sickened, forgot his
appetite and gazed, unconsciously stroking his
stomach, fascinated by that mutilated creature.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very beautiful girl, whose face might pass
her into Heaven without confession, left the
well-dressed gourmands with empty plates.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>She went and served the unfortunate one. She
cut his meat and held his napkin that caught
the drippings. She was so kind and gentle and
showed such consideration, I asked her:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that the proprietor?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your husband or sweetheart, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have none.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Un pauvre poilu.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, we were in a peasant woman’s farmhouse.
She wore wooden shoes, without socks.
Just home from work in the fields, she asked
two convalescent soldiers to help drink a bottle
of wine, and we sat and talked with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she said, her dark eyes shining with
pride, “my husband was a soldier, too. He is
now a prisoner in Germany. This is his photograph.
Don’t you think he looks well? He
was a machine gunner in Alsace. He did not
run away when the Germans came, but stayed
and worked the gun.” Then, speaking of a well
dressed little girl sitting on my Egyptian comrade’s
knee: “He has never seen her—she is
only two years old and thinks every soldier is
papa.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Hanging from the roof was a row of dried
sausages. Pointing to them she said: “Yes, I
send him a package every week and never forget
to put in a sausage. Don’t you think from
the photograph he looks well?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the stable were two milch cows and a
young heifer. Indicating the latter, she said:
“He has not seen her, either. When he comes
home I am going to kill her, faire le bomb, and
ask all the family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The look of pride changed into a haunted,
painful, far-away gaze: “Oh, dear, we shall
all be women! Except my husband and Francois,
my brother, all our men are dead—four of
my brothers! Francois is the last. The Government
sent him from the front to keep the
family alive. Don’t you think France was good
to us to do that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>When in hospital I met the grand dame from
the nearby chateau. She harnessed her own
horse and drove through the rain, on a wintry
morning, to play the organ at early mass. She
nursed a ward in the hospital through the day
and returned home alone in the darkness to
make her own supper.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh,” she said, “I don’t mind it, I do what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>can. I was not brought up right or I could be
of more use. Before the war, we had fifteen
servants. They are now at war. We have
only two left, a half-wit and a cripple.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you know,” she said, “I have never heard
the English marching song ‘Tipperary.’ I just
love music. In Tours the other day, I saw it
on sale, my hand was in my pocket before I
knew. But I happened to think of our brave
soldiers; they need so many things”—</p>

<p class='c014'>Noticing the troubled look on the usually
serene countenance of a very good friend, I
asked her: “Why those clouds?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh,” she replied, “they have just called
Gaston to the colors. His class is called up.
You know how I have pinched and saved to
bring that boy up right. Now, he must go
and I cannot make myself feel glad. I ought
to feel proud, but I cannot. I don’t feel right.
Every time I look at him I think of my husband
and his one leg.”</p>

<p class='c014'>During the early days of the war I was out
with my landlady, whose calculating instinct
in the matter of extra charges separated me
from all my loose change. Going past the
Gare d’Est Paris we noticed a crowd about a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>French soldier. He had a German helmet in
his hand. Walking up to him, she said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A German helmet, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you get that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you get it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here, take this, go back and get some
more.” She passed her pocketbook over to the
poilu.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier stared; the crowd stared; but the
soldier was a thoroughbred. Crooking his
elbow and sticking the helmet out on his index
finger, he bowed:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will Madame give me pleasure by accepting
the helmet?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Would she! Boche helmets were scarce in
those days. Beautiful Mademoiselles in that
crowd would have given their souls to possess
such a treasure! Neither they nor I know
Madame. Her eyes looked level into those of
the soldier as she demanded:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not a Parisian?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To what province are you going?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Brittany.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“When?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At six o’clock tonight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you a wife?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you do something for me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With the greatest pleasure!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, keep that casque in your hand until
you arrive in Brittany. Then give it to your
wife. She will always love you for it and your
children will never forget such a father!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Walking away, Madame dropped into a silent
mood. I looked at her curiously. Was she
sorry she had given away her money? Did she
regret not accepting that highly-prized helmet,
or was she thinking of the pleasure that gift
would give the soldier’s wife?</p>

<p class='c001'>Suddenly she turned and said: “Well, one
thing is certain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is certain?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will have to pay my car fare home.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>The self-sacrifice and devotion of the women
permeates the atmosphere—from the lowest to
the highest. It is contagious. It is evident,
even to a stranger, and it restores his faith
in human nature. She is the other half
of the poilu. He excels in courage and fortitude.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>She completes him with an untiring zeal.</p>

<p class='c001'>One beautiful, romantic feature of French
army life is the adoption
of soldiers by god-mothers.
In one instance, a girl
fifteen years of age, having
enough money, adopted
a half dozen. One of
them proved to be a
Senegalize, who wished
to take the young lady
back to Africa to complete
his harem!</p>

Upon the front since the 9th of May, 1915, he has always volunteered for the dangerous missions and the most perilous posts.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The uncertainties and
possibilities of the situation
distract the soldier’s
mind from his real,
staring troubles. His
thoughts are directed into
pleasant channels.
The lady sends him little
comforts, extra food, or
money and, maybe, invites
him to spend his
furlough at her residence.
She always does,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>if he is from invaded territory. If they prove
congenial, friendship sometimes ripens into
love and love into marriage. It relieves the
lonesome isolation of the soldier, and gives
the woman a direct, personal interest in the
war.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the spring of 1916 I stood at the Spouters’
Corner in Hyde Park, London, where Free
Speech England allows its undesirables to express
themselves. Here the authorities classify,
label and wisely permit each particular crank
or freak to here blow off surplus gas. If suppressed,
it might explode or fester and become
a menace.</p>

<p class='c001'>In French uniform I was listening to the
quips of a woman lecturer who really was a
treat. “Yes,” she cried out, “Mr. Asquith has
asked us poor people to economize. Instead
of spending three shillings a day, we must only
spend two; and our average wage is but a bob
and a half. The high cost of living is nothing
to the cost of high living. When Mr. Asquith
pushes that smooth, bald head of his up through
the Golden Gates, St. Peter will think it is a
bladder of lard, and lard is worth two shillings
per pound. So he will ‘wait and see’ if he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>use it at the price.” (English call Asquith Mr.
“Wait and See.”) “Yes,” she continued, “I
try to be careful to make things last as long
as possible. Instead of buying a new petticoat,
I now change the one I have wrong side
out and make it last twice as long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I was absorbing these subleties when a
French lady, dressed in velvet and furs, noticing
my faded blue uniform, stepped up, excused
herself, and asked if I were not a French soldier,
and would I have a cup of tea with her?</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, I found my god-mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>One year later, again on furlough, passing
through London, I called on my good friend
and was invited to accompany her to church.
After a long prayer, so long as to excite my
curiosity, she whispered: “I used to come here
every Sunday and pray for you. In this seat, at
this part of the ceremony, I prayed you would
come back again. I wanted you here with me
today so I could show you to God. Now I am
content. He will take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Opening her prayer-book, she took out a piece
of paper and pressed it into my hand. It was
an extract from a London newspaper, which
told of my being decorated by the French Government.
I had not told her, and was not aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the news had been in the London papers. At
the house, later, Captain Underwood, one of
Rawlinson’s invalided veterans, who was in
the retreat from Antwerp, inquired: “Did our
friend show you the paper?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, she bought that newspaper one night
and came here crying out, ‘See what my poilu
has done, and he never said a word to me about
it!’ When you blew in, she made us promise
we would not mention it till after you came

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> DEMOCRACY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Democratic Government is the direct opposite
of the German system. In America the
individual is superior to the state, on the
principle that man was born before the state
was organized. He was then first, endowed
by Nature with certain inalienable rights,
such as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p class='c001'>He organized a government to make those
rights secure with the state as servant—not
master of his destiny. The public official is
just the people’s hired man. He is not paid to
give, or to permit, one set of individuals to gain
advantage. He must enforce equality, and see
that every citizen has equal rights with equal
opportunities. Where rights are equal, privileges
must be. Where then is inequality of
rights then is inequality of privilege. The
burden, shirked by the privileged class, is
thrown upon those whose rights have been
usurped, making their load doubly heavy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>In time of peace, preparedness is the premium
paid for war insurance. During war,
impartial, obligatory military service is based
on equality of men.</p>

<p class='c001'>The danger to democratic institutions lies
not in the people, but in those that prey upon
them, who, having obtained unfair privilege,
not satisfied, continually grasp for more. We
have seen what inequality has done to the Germans
and we do not want it in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>This war should sound the death knell of the
professional politician. The trimmer, carrying
water on both shoulders has schemed for
power white others worked. Afraid of losing
votes, he did not stand up for the right. He
goes into the discard, replaced by men of ability
and courage.  Leaders of the people will
remove the inefficient tool of privilege.</p>

<p class='c001'>War is a habit breaker? It is a series of jolts.
The start of the war was a jolt. The day of
peace will be another. Just as one trench is
wiped out and another made, some day we shall
wake to find frontiers gone, the whole map of
Europe changed, with the people ruling where
were kings. Nothing will be the same. Old
thoughts, ideas, beliefs, prejudices, humbugs—social,
political and religious, will have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>thrown into the melting pot. The bogus will
disappear and only Truth remain.</p>

<p class='c014'>French Law and Equality are based on natural
justice. That the people have won and
are the basis of their liberty. The magistrates,
the judges of duty, the legislators, are the
means used to secure these liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>They maintain that men are born and should
live, free, with equal rights and duties, that
social distinction should be founded, not on
wealth or nobility, but on public benefits to the
community, that honors should be given to the
most able, to the most faithful, without distinction
of wealth or birth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rights are, liberty, property, security and
resistance to oppression. Liberty is a natural
right.  Force, time, circumstance shall not
abolish it. It is not liberty to do its own will,
regardless of others. Individual liberty stops,
where the rights of the community commence.
The object of political association is the preservation
of rights.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principle of sovereignty rests in the
people, as expressed through their representatives.
The Law is the written expression of the
people’s will. It is the guarantee of rights to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>all. All citizens need the law. All are eligible
to be honored by dispensing or enforcing its
requirements.</p>

<p class='c001'>All shall pay toward the administration of
Government, and all shall fight to maintain it.
No man shall be stopped or delayed except by
law. Those who issue arbitrary or unlawful
orders shall be punished. All men are accepted
as innocent till proved guilty. A man has a
right to express his opinion and religious convictions,
provided they are not contrary to law.</p>

<p class='c001'>The law, on its part, does not interfere with
dogmas or schisms, but assures to each man
liberty of expression and action, to think, and
speak, write and circulate, that which he believes
true. This free expression of ideas makes
Public Opinion, which is for the advantage of
all, not for the exclusive use of some few to
whom it may be confided. It is the safeguard
of independent and does not make for oppression.
Public Opinion creates the Law, which,
in turn, becomes the guarantee of the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>All law-makers, dispensing agents, public
servants, must make a report of their administration
when called on for it by the people.
The rights of men are absolutely guaranteed by
the laws being rigorously applied, impartially.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Those, who, elected to power, use that power
for their own private ends, rather than for the
good of all, are punished.</p>

<p class='c001'>Behind the army and the woman, are the
Cabinet, the Senate, and the Chamber of
Deputies—the leaders of thought and action.
The people, as thus represented, are the
supreme power, the army is subordinate.
France is a people with an army. Germany
is an army with a people. Democratic France
insists on equality, even in military life. It
will not permit an officer to grant himself, or
his friends, furloughs which are denied private
soldiers. As the private soldier may be court-martialed
for his sins, so may the general officer,
who, through drunkenness, inefficiency or
treachery, sacrifices his men or betrays the
people. He is not whitewashed, or taken from
the front and given an appointment in the
rear—kicked upstairs instead of down. He is
given his sentence and compelled to serve it.</p>

<p class='c001'>No brutal or surly officer can chain a private
soldier to an artillery wagon like a dog. No
drunken officer can hurl insults at him. Hanging
over the heads of all, like the suspended
sword of Damocles, is French equality, which
insists on results, not excuses. It falls on brutality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and inefficiency. Consequently, French
officers are invariably gentlemen and treat their
men as such.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every country has its slackers, its pacifists,
its millionaires, its religious fanatics, who do
not scruple to use their isms, wealth and special
privilege to undermine the fabric of a government
which compels them to bear their share
of duty. Consequently, civilian leaders must be
strong, determined, resolute men, who swerve
not from the good ahead, who will neither tolerate
special pleadings nor permit incapacity.
They know that, prevented by continually
changing officers, graft conditions cannot become
established, also, that all around experience
begets perfection. Soldiers’ lives must
not be sacrificed at the front while profiteers
fatten in the rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this war has demonstrated any one thing,
it is that those who “born to rule” have not
the capacity to do so. Filling places of public
trust, through accident of wealth, or birth,
or political expediency, at the outbreak of hostilities—that
cunning, calculating fraud on
democracy, the political machine—appointed
or elected to serve the people, scheming for
partizan advantage, really blocked national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>effort and actually, through inaction and
obstruction, aided the enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Incapable of mastering a new set of circumstances,
persisting in playing the new game
according to the old rules, those appointed
failed. Others took up the burden. From the
ranks of men rose the leaders of thought and
action, stepping, climbing, pushing over the
incompetents of title, money and birth, who,
unable to save themselves, now accept salvation
from those whom they have hated, despised,
oppressed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advancing in spite of obstacles—the more
opposition, the better, the man worthy to lead,
clarified by adversity, true to form, takes the
public into confidence, talking, not in commonplace
generalities, but concrete truths, Lloyd
George of England, Hughes of Australia,
Briand, Clemenceau and Viviani of France,
Kerensky of Russia, Veneviolis of Greece, Sam
Hughes of Canada, Teddy Roosevelt and
Woodrow Wilson of America, strong, upright
and brave men, who scorn the bended knee and
itching palm, are hated by the professional
politician and the piratical profiteer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every man, who has courage to stand for the
right and denounce the wrong, becomes a mark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>for bricks thrown at his devoted head—by
shirkers who won’t protect their own—by
rascals who have been looting the public—and
by traitors who would betray their country.
These leaders have terrific opposition in
their fight against systematized, anti-national
organizations. It is the duty of every citizen,
in times of national danger, to support the Government,
regardless of party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX <br /> AUTOCRACY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>German Government is founded on the principle
that the State is superior to the individual.
Being superior, it is not subject to that code of
honor, that respect for decency, which binds
men of different races, religions and countries
and distinguishes man from the brute.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Reichstag of Germany is supposed to be
the popular assembly. In reality, it is the bulwark
of wealth. Under this system, man belongs
to property, not property to man. Voters,
who have paid one-third of the total income
tax, elect one-third of the electors, who choose
one-third of the Reichstag. Voters who pay
the next third do likewise, and the same system
applies to the last third. In 1908, 293,000 voters
chose the first third; 1,065,240 selected the second
third, and 6,324,079 elected the last third.
Thus, 4 per cent of the voters elected the first
third, 14 per cent the second, and the last third,
82 per cent—all the poor people were thrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>together and controlled by the other two-thirds,
or 18 per cent.</p>

<p class='c001'>In free countries, the State exists for the
benefit of the individual. In Germany, the
individual lives exclusively for the State. He
has no right to free speech, free thought, the
pursuit of happiness, nor even to existence
itself, unless the Kaiser sees it to his advantage
to grant, or permit, those luxuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>In case a popular measure slipped through
the Reichstag, it would have to be voted upon
by the Bundesrath—a secret upper house appointed
by the princes—not the people, of each
separate State of the German Empire. Each
State votes as a unit. No amendment can pass
the Bundesrath if fourteen out of the sixty-one
votes are cast against it. The Kaiser, representing
Prussia, holds seventeen votes, and
three for Alsace-Lorraine. So, the individual
German voter’s work is carefully nullified by
this system, over which he has no control. He
is outvoted by wealth in the Reichstag. The
Reichstag is outvoted by the aristocracy of the
Bundesrath. This, in turn, is outvoted by the
Autocracy of the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c001'>Autocracy, aristocracy and wealth compose
the Board of Strategy and officer the army.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>The army is superior to the Reichstag. It is
outside of and above the law, within the country
but not responsible to it. It is not an army
of the people, it is the Kaiser’s army.</p>

<p class='c001'>So the Bundesrath, the Reichstag, the Board
of Strategy, the controlled newspapers and
political professors, extending down from the
throneroom to the kindergarten, are meshes in
the net that entangles man whose rights they
have usurped. Through that system, the child
is caught in infancy, given Kultur with
mother’s milk, then taught to spy upon family
and neighbors; he listens to political professors
at school, political parsons at church. The
more he informs the further he advances, till
he reaches the army, where docility and obedience
and respect for authority are instilled
into him till he can have neither original ideas
nor independent thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is told he is under no obligation to observe
elementary decency, that there is no honor
among men or nations. He is taught to hate,
not to love, to depend on might, not right, and
to work for war instead of peace. The French,
the British, the Americans are only human, but
the good Kaiser is divine, and the German is
a super-man, chosen by God to rule the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The “good Kaiser” was chosen by God to dominate
the German race, who are to conquer the
world, and the German super-man, under the
Kaiser, is to obtain that domination through
war.</p>

<p class='c001'>A woman who has compassion in her soul
for the unfortunate has no right to live. Pity
is not German. Miss Cavel had pity in her
heart, even for German wounded, for homeless
Belgians. So she was executed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The wounded in hospital ships were torpedoed
without warning, murdered by unseen
hands reaching out from the darkness, and the
perpetrators were promoted for gallantry.</p>

<p class='c001'>After robbing and burning the towns of
northern France and Belgium they turned
around and demanded an indemnity, having picked
the victim’s pocket, they asked for his
money. They robbed the priceless libraries to
preserve the books. They drove, the vanquished
victims into slavery to protect them
from laziness, and raped woman to save her
virginity. The French, English or American
who rapes a woman, desecrates a church, or
murders innocent women and children, knows
he commits a crime—the German lacks such
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>So, unchecked, uncontrolled, responsible to
no one, they are wild beasts at large. Backed
by an army of 11,000,000 men, they tried to
overwhelm peace-loving Europe. They <a id='corr237.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='overrun'>overran</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_237.4'><ins class='correction' title='overrun'>overran</ins></a></span>
Luxemburg. They turned the garden of
France into a desert. They could see in Belgium
only the nearest road to France. Subject
to no restraint, responsible to no one, their
passion for power, for money, for lust, recognized
no authority, contract, nor law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their ungovernable tempers became inflamed
at the slightest opposition and they do
not scruple to commit the most odious crimes
upon the unfortunate people in their power.
Repression, terrorism, theft, rape and murder
are elevated into virtues and rewarded with
honors. By brute force they <a id='corr237.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='overide'>override</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_237.17'><ins class='correction' title='overide'>override</ins></a></span> decency,
freedom, arbitration and liberty. Murderers
at bay, they fight to keep from being executed.</p>

<p class='c001'>And, as the German people were compelled
to work for them in time of peace, now they
must die for them in time of war.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the German Government.</p>

<p class='c014'>At The Hague Convention, 1907, the following
were agreed to and signed by Germany.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>ARTICLE 24. <span class='small'>“It is forbidden to kill or wound
an enemy who has dropped his arms or has no means
of defense, and who surrenders at discretion.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'>ARTICLE 46. <span class='small'>“The honor and the rights of the
people, the lives of the family, the private property
must be respected.”</span></p>

<p class='c014'>“August 23, 1914, at Gomery, Belgium, a German
patrol entered the ambulance, fired upon
the wounded, killed the doctor and shot the
stretcher bearers.” Part of a deposition of Dr.
Simon, in Red Cross Service, 10th Region.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The night of the 22d (August, 1914), I
found in the woods at 150 yards to the north
of the crossroads, formed by the meeting of
the large trench of Colonne with the road of
Vaux de Palaneix to St. Remy, the bodies of
French prisoners shot by the Germans. I saw
thirty soldiers who had been gathered together
in a little space, for the most part lying down,
a few on their knees, and all mutilated the same
way by being shot in the eye.” Affidavit of a
captain of the 288th Infantry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We saw there an execution squad. Before
it lay, on the slope of the side of the road, fifty
bodies of French prisoners who had just been
shot. We approached and saw one hapless Red
Cross man who had not been spared. A non-commissioned
officer was finishing off with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>revolver shots any who still moved. He gave
us, in German, the order to point out to him
those of our men who still breathed.” Report
of Dr. Chou, who was captured and repatriated.
He related the above to a Danish physician, Dr.
De Christmas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I saw a British prisoner killed by a sentry
at point blank range, because he did not stop
at the command. Another British soldier was
shot by a sentry with whom he had a discussion.
The shot broke his jaw; he died next
day.” Report of Sergt. Major Le Bihran, narrating
conditions at Gottingen.</p>

<p class='c014'>The French Government has the note book
of a German soldier, Albert Delfosse of the
111th Infantry of the 14th Reserve Corps. “In
the forest near St. Remy, on the 4th or 5th of
September, I encountered a very fine cow and
calf, dead, and again, the bodies of French men,
fearfully mutilated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The attack of September 25, 1915, brought
the French within two kilometers of Somme-py.
Lying in the trenches under the furious bombardment,
we considered the diary which was
found on the German soldier, Hassemer, of
the 8th Army Corps, when they captured the
town in 1914: “Horrible carnage; the villages
totally burned; the French thrown into the
burning houses; the civilians burned with all
the others.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>I have many times been at St. Maurice,
Meurthe and Moselle, where I saw and pondered
over, fire-blackened houses and somber-faced,
solitary women. The tall chimney of
a demolished manufacturing plant stands guard
over desolation. From the diary of a Bavarian
soldier of the <a id='corr241.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Germany'>German</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_241.8'><ins class='correction' title='Germany'>German</ins></a></span> army, evidence written
by the perpetrators, the following is quoted:
“The village of St. Maurice was encircled, the
soldiers advanced at one yard apart, through
which line nobody could get. Afterward the
Uhlans started the fire, house by house.
Neither man, nor woman, nor child could get
away. They were permitted to take out the
cattle because that was a drawing out method.
Those that risked to run away were killed by
rifle shot. All those that were found in the
village were burned with it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the first lot of exchanged English prisoners
returned from Germany was a Gloucester
man shot in his jaws, his teeth blackened and
broken. Pointing to where his chin had been,
he told me: “That is what they did to me—what
they did after I was taken prisoner and
was wounded in four places and unable to
move. A Boche came along, put his rifle to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>face and pulled the trigger. But that wasn’t
anything to what they did to my comrade. He
was lying in his blanket seriously wounded,
and a Boche ran a bayonet into him sixteen
times before he died.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the clearing house hospital at Lyons I
saw two old comrades meet, one wounded,
from the front, the other from a German prison
camp. “Yes,” said the latter, with a peculiar,
vacant expression in his eye. “Yes, I was crucified.
I was hung from a beam in the middle
of the camp for two hours, hands tied together
over my head, in the form of a cross, body hanging
down till my feet were eighteen inches
above the ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that true?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“True, look at these arms. Ask those comrades
over there. I swear it, I will write it
down for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He wrote the above statement and signed
his name, Gandit, Pierre, 19th Infantry.</p>

<p class='c014'>August 28, 1914. “The French soldiers who
were captured were led away. Those seriously
wounded, in the head or lungs, etc., who could
not get up, were put out of their misery, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to orders, by another shot.” An extract
from the diary of a German soldier, Fahlenstein,
34th Fusiliers II Army. The original
is in the hands of the French Government.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Ethe, finding twenty wounded men
stretched out in a shed, unable to move, they
burned the shed and roasted them alive.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Gomery a temporary, first aid hospital
was captured. A Boche sergeant and a group
of soldiers rushed in, assaulted the doctor in
charge and burned the building. The wounded
men, some of whom had had amputations that
same morning, maddened by the flames,
jumped out of the windows into the garden,
where they were bayonetted by the waiting
fiends. Dr. De Charette, Lieutenant Jeanin
and about one hundred and twenty wounded
French officers and men were butchered. This
hospital was under command of Dr. Sedillat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Russians were treated like beasts, but
among those emaciated, ragged creatures, the
most miserable of all, the most cruelly used
of all are the British. They were always the
last and the worst served. If ill, they were

more clothing to sell to buy food, they came
to the hospital utterly exhausted, stark naked,
and died of hunger. It was a sight to pierce
the heart.” Report of Dr. Monsaingeon, of the
French Medical Service, on conditions at Gustrout

the French Foreign Officers and printed in
“Treatment of French Prisoners in Germany.”</p>

“We reached a little hollow in the ground,
where many red breeches, killed and wounded,
were lying. We bayonetted some of the
wounded and smashed in the skulls of others.
Nearby I heard a singular crushing sound. It
was caused by the blows one of our 154th men

Our adversaries had fought bravely, but,
whether slightly or severely wounded, our
brave Fusiliers spared our country the expense
of having to nurse so many enemies.”</p>

generations, from Prince Eitel Fritz, the son
of the Kaiser, who looted the Chateau Brierry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Avocourt, down to the under officers, who
searched private residences, which, open to the
captors, it was forbidden to lock. It is a record
of shame and dishonor, of brutal force, without
a saving element of mercy. They struck
their helpless victims singly, in groups, in
hecatombs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Individually, they followed the systematic
teaching of organized butchery. The world
knows about the murder of Miss Cavell, the
Red Cross nurse; of Eugene Jacquet, the Freemason;
of Captain Fryatt, the civilian sea-captain.
This little book records the death of
many others, innocent martyrs to the same
glorious cause.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Foret the public school teacher refused to
tread the French flag underfoot and was shot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Schaffen, A Willem was burned alive, two
others were interred alive. Madame Luykx
and daughter, twelve years of age, refuging
together in a cave, were shot. J. Reynolds and
his nephew of ten years were shot, out in the
street.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Sompius, an old man, Jacquimin, 70 years
of age, was tied to his bed by an officer and left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>there three days. He died shortly after his
deliverance.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Monceau-Sur-Sambre they shut up the
two brothers S. in a shed and burned them alive.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Momemy, M. Adam was thrown alive into
the fire, then shot at with rifles and Mme.
Cousine, after being shot, was thrown into the
fire and roasted.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Maixe, M. Demange, wounded in both
knees, fell helpless in his house, and they set
fire to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Triancourt, Mme. Maupoix, 75 years old,
was kicked to death because not enough loot
was found in her closet.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Conis, Madame Dalissier, 73 years, who
declared she had no money, was shot through
the body fifteen times.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Rouyes, a farmer refused to tell where he
got some French military clothes. An officer
shot him twice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>At Crezancy, M. Le Saint, 18 years of age,
was killed by an officer because some day he
would be a soldier.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Embermenil, Mme. Masson was shot because
her servant, an idiot, gave a wrong direction.
The madame, pregnant, was made to sit
on a chair while they executed her.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Ethe one hundred and ninety-seven were
executed, among them two priests, who were
shot because they were accused of hiding arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Marqueglise, a superior officer stopped
four young boys, and, saying that the Belgians
were dirty people, he shot each one in succession.
One was killed outright.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Pin, the Uhlans met two young boys,
whom they tied to their horses, then urged
them to a gallop. Some kilometers away, the
bodies were found, the skin worn away from
the knees, one with throat cut, both with many
bullet holes through the head.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Sermaize, the farmer Brocard and his son
were arrested. His wife and daughter-in-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>were thrown into a near-by river. Four hours
later, the men were set at liberty and found the
two bodies of the women in the water, with
several bullet holes in their heads.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Aerschot, the priest had hung a cross in
front of the church. He was tied, hands and
feet, the inhabitants ordered to march past and
urinate on him. They then shot him and threw
the body into the canal. A group of seventy-eight
men, tied three together, were taken into
the country, assaulted en route, and shot at and
killed the following morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Monchy-Humieres, an officer heard the
word “Prussians” spoken. He ordered three
dragoons to fire into the group, one was killed,
two wounded, one of them was a little girl of
four years.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Hermeuil, while looting the town, the
inhabitants were confined in a church. Mme.
Winger and her three servants, arriving late,
the captain, monocle in his eye, ordered the
soldiers to fire. The four were killed.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Sommeilles, while the town was being
burned, the Dame X. with her four children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>sought refuge in a cave with her neighbor,
Adnot, and his wife. Some days later, the
French troops, recapturing the town, found
the seven bodies, horribly mutilated, lying in
a sea of blood. The Dame had her right arm
severed from the body, a young girl, eleven
years of age, had one foot cut off, the little boy,
five years old, had his throat cut.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Louveigne, a number of civilians took
refuge in a blacksmith shop. In the afternoon
the Germans opened the door, chased out the
victims, and as they ran out shot them down
like so many rabbits. Seventeen bodies were
left lying on the plain.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Senlis the mayor of the town and six of
the city council were shot to death.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Coalommiers a husband and two children
testified to the rape of the mother of the family.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Melen-Labouche, Marguerite Weras was
outraged by twenty German soldiers before she
was shot, in sight of her father and mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Louppy le Chateau, it is the grandmother
who is violated, and, in the same town, a mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and two daughters, thirteen and eight years
old, were also victims of German savagery.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Nimy, little Irma G., in six hours, was
done to death. Her father, going to her aid,
was shot, her mother, seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Handzaerne, the mayor, going to the aid
of his daughter, was shot.</p>

<p class='c014'>At St. Mary’s Pass, two sergeants of the
31st Alpines were found with their throats cut.
Their bayonets were thrust into their mouths.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Remereville, Lieutenant Toussant, lying
wounded on the battlefield, was jabbed with
bayonets by all the Germans who passed him.
The body was punctured with wounds from the
feet to the head.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Audrigny, a German lieutenant met a
Red Cross ambulance, carrying ten wounded
men. He deployed his men and fired two
rounds into the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Bonville, in a barn, a German officer shot
in the eye nine wounded French soldiers, who,
lying stretched out, were unable to move.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>At Montigny le Titcul, the Germans discovered
M. Vidal dressing the wounds of a
French soldier, L. Sohier, who was shot in the
head. M. Vidal was shot at sight, then the
wounded man was killed.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Nary, they compelled twenty-five women
to march parallel with them as a shield against
the French fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Malinas, six German soldiers, who had
captured five young girls, placed the girls in
a circle about them when attacked.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Hongaerdi they killed the priest.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Erpe, the Germans forced thirty civilians,
one only thirteen years old, to march ahead,
while, hidden among the crowd were German
soldiers and a machine gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Ouen-Sur-Morin, on Sept. 7, 1914, the
Death’s Head Huzzars, the Crown Prince’s
favorite regiment, drove all the civilians into
the Chateau, then, sheltered by those innocents,
they told the English, “Shoot away.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>At Parchim, where 2,000 civilians, French
prisoners, were interned, two prisoners, hungry,
demanding food, were clubbed to death
with the butt end of rifles, while the young
daughter of one of them was immediately given
eight days <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“mis au poteau.”</span></p>

<p class='c014'>At Gerberviller, at the home of Lingenheld,
they searched for his son, a stretcher bearer of
the Red Cross, tied his hands, led him into the
street and shot him down. Then they poured
oil on the body and roasted it. Then the father,
of 70 years, was executed, along with fourteen
other old men. More than fifty were martyred
in this commune alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sister Julia, Superior of the Hospital Gerberviller,
reports: “To break into the tabernacle
of the Church of Gerberviller the enemy
fired many shots around the lock, the interior
of the ciborium was also perforated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Statement of Mlle. ——, tried and acquitted for
the murder of her infant, in Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At Gerberviller, I worked in the hospital.
Going to the church one night, three German
hospital stewards caught and assaulted me. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>did not understand their language. I thought
they were men. I did not know they were
brutes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I killed the child; I could not bear to
feel myself responsible for bringing anything
into the world made by the workings of a German.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In Belgium alone, more than 20,000 homes
have been pillaged and burned. More than
5,000 civilians, mostly old men, women and
children, with fifty priests and one hundred
and eighty-seven doctors, have been murdered.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Timines, 400 civilians were murdered.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Dinant, more than 600 were martyred,
among them seventy-one women, 34 old men,
more than 70 years of age, six children of from
five to six years of age, eleven children less than
five years. The victims were placed in two
ranks, the first kneeling, the second standing,
then shot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foregoing statements, vouched for by
the most responsible representative men in and
near the invaded district, are some of the cases
continually being brought to public attention.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>This evidence is accumulative, convincing,
damning proof, it is furnished by the bodies of
the victims, by neighbor eye witnesses, by devastated,
homes, and by mutilated wrecks, who
survived—some being recaptured by French
troops, others, repatriated as useless, sent back
to France via Switzerland.</p>

<p class='c014'>These, and other crimes, are corroborated in
the four reports of the French Inquiry, in “Violations
of International Law,” published, by order
of the French Foreign Minister, by the
twenty-two reports of the Belgian Commission,
the reports of a German book published
May 15, 1915, diaries and note books found on
bodies of dead German soldiers, wounded men
and prisoners. They are books of horror, but,
books of truth, glaring evidence of murdered
men, misused women, ruined homes. Much of
them is actually furnished by perpetrators of
the deeds. Comments are unnecessary, words
inadequate, cold print fails.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The natives fled from the village. It was
horrible. There was clotted blood on the
beards, and the faces we saw were terrible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>behold. The dead—about sixty—were at once
buried; among them were many old women,
some old men and a half-delivered woman, awful
to see. Three children had clasped each
other and died thus. The altar and vault of the
church were shattered. They had a telephone
there to communicate with the enemy. This
morning, Sept. 2, all the survivors were expelled,
and I saw four little boys carrying a
cradle with a baby five or six months old in it,
on two sticks—all this was terrible to behold.
Shot after shot, salvo after salvo—chickens,
etc. all killed. I saw a mother with her two children,
one had a great wound in the head and
had lost an eye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I met a company of the 18th U. S. Engineers
swinging along the tree-fringed macadamized
highway toward the front. Clean-cut, well
dressed, smooth-shaven, happy and gay. It was
a joy to see them. It made a man feel proud to
belong to the same race. They yelled a greeting
in broken French to the dirty Poilu, who responded
in the latest American slang, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>marched away singing into the darkness, the
words echoing loud or low, as different sections
took up the tune:</p>

<p class='c014'>Yes, Julia Ward Howe’s hymn is quite right.
It sounds the keynote of America’s part in this
world’s greatest tragedy of all history.</p>

<p class='c001'>They returned a month later, boys no longer,
but men who had been through the fire, and
stood up to the grief. Tired, weary, chins
pressed forward; hands on the straps to permit
free heart action, dust swirled about the moving
feet, and climbed up and settled on the
stubby, unshaven face, streaked with perspiration,
which in turn rose and formed an aura
about the knapsack, as it bobbed up and down
like a buoy on the sea. From behind the dust-topped
bristles flash the steely eyes of the Soldier.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such eyes! Not the calm, contemplative eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>of the sissy, but the strong, fierce, exaltant eyes
of the man who has fought, and won.</p>

<p class='c001'>One month had changed him; the longer he
is in the Army the greater the change. Already
he has seen there are things greater than fear,
found something greater than Life.</p>

<p class='c001'>He has realized that in union there is
strength, that soldiers by acting together as a
unit gain the objective, which brings the victory.</p>

<p class='c001'>He wondered at the confidence of the French
Poilu, and discovered that behind that soldier is
every man, woman and child, every ounce of
energy, every cent of money in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>His mind wanders to his native land across
the sea. True the Government is behind him—but
all the people are not behind the Government.
The International Socialist is still bent
on destruction, and working for Germany; the
pro-German is hiding his galvanized Americanism
behind Red Cross and Liberty Loan buttons;
the chatauquaized pacifist bemoaning this
“terrible bloodshed” is trying to dig himself
into a hole, where he can escape the U. S. draft.
The foreign-language minister—exempted
from military service, the only privileged class
in America—is still talking denominationalism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>instead of patriotism; the Big Business banker,
a deacon in church, prays with the Methodist
sisters, works hand in glove with monopolists
who have preyed upon the people, then offers 5
per cent in competition with the Government
4-1/4 per cent. He wants to make a profit for
himself, rather than have the Government use
the money to feed and clothe the soldiers on the
front. The prohibitionists, not satisfied with
war-time prohibition, with the control of liquor
by the Government, through the Food Administration,
wants to further embarrass the Government
by agitating minor issues when every
ounce of energy is needed to win the war. They
know the soldier will come back a broader and
wiser man, and they want to slip this legislation
over in his absence. Then there is the
political lawyer who thrives on trouble, gets fat
on disaster, whose capital is wind, surplus hot
air, whose services are for sale for cash. Usually
a trimmer who crawled on his stomach for
favors, he pledged himself in advance for votes.
Backed by special interests, these decoys play
upon the passions and prejudices of men, they
array class against class, religion against religion,
section against section. Elected by the people
whom they betray, the people in return organize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>for protection, then the hypocrites wrap
the robes of loyalty about themselves, rush to
the head of the procession, climb the band wagon,
seize the bass drum, and cry out: all those
who don’t follow are “drunken, dishonest or
disloyal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Beclouding the main issue—of America’s
danger—scheming for power while soldiers die,
too busy serving themselves, they have not
time to serve the nation, they cannot see that
their day is past and that they must give way
to the men who will win the war—the soldier,
the laborer, the producer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The living soldier is part of the Government,
he sees through and past the self-seeking tool
or profiteer. He is not fooled by the political
machine. He is no longer Republican, Socialist
or Prohibitionist—he is American.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supported by the non-denominational Red
Cross and Y. M. C A., he is no longer Baptist,
Methodist or Mormon—his religion is confined
to Right and Wrong.</p>

<p class='c014'>That may be all right living; but what of the
dead? Dead? Who are the dead? Surely not
the unselfish spirits who sacrificed their bodies
on the altar of freedom. Their deeds and glory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>are immortal. Are they, themselves; anything
less?</p>

<p class='c001'>“They have passed into eternity,” we are accustomed
to say. Eternity? Do you limit
eternity? Can you locate eternity’s beginning,
eternity’s end?</p>

<p class='c001'>Then shall we presume to think those noble
spirits who went forward to keep our own temporary
abiding place safe for us a while longer,
dead?</p>

<p class='c001'>Water rises to its source—that is common
knowledge. But, if we actually cannot see the
thing, we often rely on established mental
habit, prescribed for us, long since, by others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soldier, facing the truly big things of
life, who learns to discard, in emergency, the
book of rules, cannot believe his comrade,
whose lifeless, torn body he left on the field, but
whose spirit still inspires him, dead. In the
strong days of his youth, he remembers, now,
his Creator. He knows his absent comrade’s
spirit lives—as does his own, responding to that
urge to victory! and he knows that they shall
both return unto God who gave them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is for us, still humanly on the job, to so
manage that, when such brave spirits come
back, either to resume their interrupted tasks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>or to take on greater, we shall have faithfully
done our bit to make this old world a better
place in which to live and work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Science, from her laboratory, reports that
nothing is ever lost. Real religion and science
agree.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
